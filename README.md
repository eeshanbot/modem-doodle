#### figures
- [ ] HYCOM + ITP data blended --- transparency plot (prior information)
- [ ] EOF shapes and weight distributions (prior compressed information)
- [ ] CTD casts (in-situ sampling and estimation)
- [ ] Diagram of modem placement (experimental design)
- [ ] Histogram of OWTT between each source-receiver pair, sorted by depth-pair, colored by baseval/update
- [ ] Histogram of RANGE between each source-receiver pair, sorted by depth-pair, colored by baseval/update
- [ ] Comparison between model and data
- [ ] Bootstrap EOFs/weights to create synthetic profiles and run previous raytracing calculation for each input EOF file.  Also, convergence of model solution from N=10,100,1000,10000...
- [ ] bootstrap error estimate for different travel times and input files
