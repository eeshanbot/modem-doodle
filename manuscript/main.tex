% The motivation behind this work is to improve the standard LBL navigationâ€™s conversion of travel time to range for an under-ice environment in a way that could be generalized to any acoustic waveguide. To do this, we introduce the Minimal Bounce Criteria method to operationalize real-time acoustic modeling into an effective horizontal group velocity estimate.

% 	This system was implemented on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) on multiple missions, including an 11 km untethered, under-ice deployment, in March 2020. The AUV was deployed through a hydrohole from Topside and due to a disk error, stalled underneath the ice surface while transmitting its perceived location. The AUV was found within a meter away from its reported location, which serves as strong (but qualitative) evidence of the navigation performance provided by the single group velocity calculation. Because the navigation updates throughout the AUV mission have no GPS ground truth to compare to, this paper evaluates the same system performance across the GPS-navigated LBL beacons. 

% 	The real-time error from the Nearest Bounce Criteria (NBC) achieves a mean absolute positioning error of 11 m. Upon further evaluation of the acoustic events, the Minimal Bounce Criteria (MBC) is run in the same automated pipeline in post-processing (akin to real-time computational constraints and needs) and achieves an error of roughly 3 m.

% 	Both the NBC and MBC pseudorange estimations are compared to the GPS data on the LBL beacons. The error itself is small and the pattern of error exhibited indicates that the GPS ground truth data has significant noise (drift) that is not replicated by either pseudorange estimation method. For the MBC in particular, the post-processing error is within the precision of the GPS sensor, suggesting that its performance rivals that of GPS.

\begin{abstract}
The long baseline (LBL) underwater navigation paradigm relies on the conversion of recorded travel time to range to trilaterate for position.
For real-time operations, this conversion assumes an isovelocity sound speed.
For re-navigation in post-processing, computationally and/or labor intensive acoustic modeling may be employed to reduce uncertainty driven by multipath arrivals.
This work demonstrates a real-time ray-based prediction method of the effective horizontal group speed to minimize vehicle position error.
\llabel{2.1} This method was implemented for a small scale AUV-LBL system in March 2020, in the Beaufort Sea, in total under-ice conditions and a double ducted acoustic propagation environment.
The vehicle was successfully deployed and recovered.
\llabel{2.2} Given the lack of GPS data throughout the vehicle's mission, however, the localization performance between GPS-linked beacon-to-beacon connections serves as a proxy for the effectiveness of this approach.
The real-time positioning error between beacons was roughly 11 meters at distances up to 3 km, matching the magnitude of corrections recorded by the AUV during field operations.
In post-processing, the localization performance is reevaluated with an operationally equivalent navigation stack using modeled, historical, and locally observed sound speed profiles for a Minimal Bounce Criteria (MBC), as deployed in real-time, and an improved ray filtering algorithm, the Nearest Bounce Criteria (NBC).
The best performing median re-positioning errors by bounce criterias are roughly 10 and 2 meters, respectively.
\llabel{2.3} Further investigation suggests that the GNSS ground truth data have some noise that is not reciprocated in the travel time data.
Re-trilateration suggests that this approach effectively extends the single meter accuracy of the deployed GNSS pucks into the water column.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:1}  
Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are increasingly capable platforms to explore and sample the ocean, particularly for remote and/or dangerous regions.
However, navigation uncertainty is a major challenge in considering AUVs as standard tools for oceanographic research.
While land and air-based robots utilize information from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) to achieve stunning location accuracy and precision throughout the duration of their missions, AUVs cannot access GNSS while underwater due to the rapid attenuation of electromagnetic waves.
Therefore, underwater vehicles have relied on any combination of dead reckoning, hydrodynamic models, inertial navigation systems, doppler velocity logs, and acoustic baseline positioning systems for navigation \citep{paull_auv_2014}.
Limiting navigation error and drift requires an AUV to periodically stall on the surface and obtain a GNSS fix to reset its position error.
This foolproof method of self-positioning is undesirable for stealth, adverse weather conditions, and mission efficiency, and inaccessible in a GPS-denied situation like an ice-covered environment.

% introduce LBL and precise statement of work
Of acoustic baseline navigation systems, long baseline (LBL) is the most GPS-like in style and scale, and most appropriate for mitigating drift without overburdening computation or payload size on the vehicle \citep{paull_auv_2014,van_uffelen_global_2021}.
The state-of-the-art for LBL outsources depth to a pressure sensor and solves the two-dimensional localization problem by assuming an isovelocity, linear scaling between one way travel time (OWTT) and range \citep{eustice_recent_2006,eustice_experimental_2007,webster_preliminary_2009,webster_advances_2012}.
This assumption is valid for short scale operations but oversimplifies propagation for larger and/or complex acoustic environments.
This paper demonstrates an embedded model-aided data processing approach to convert recorded OWTTs into pseudorange estimates.
This approach was necessitated by total under-ice conditions and a double ducted acoustic environment, in the Beaufort Sea, in March 2020, for an AUV deployment during the Ice Exercise 2020 (ICEX20).
We quantify the success of the proposed acoustic ranging method using GPS-linked beacon-to-beacon communication events, as the AUV-LBL positioning has no ground truth GNSS to compare to.

% More about LBL navigation
While RAFOS floats have championed one way ranging for re-positioning \citep{rossby_rafos_1986,duda_evaluation_2006}, the ability to do so for navigation was facilitated by \llabel{1.11} the advent of the WHOI micro-modem \citep{singh_underwater_2006} and synchronized chip scale atomic clocks \citep{gardner_second_2016}.
Several short range (less than ten kilometers) navigation efforts have achieved minimal error with a nominal sound speed value \citep{eustice_experimental_2007,webster_preliminary_2009,kepper_mems_2017}.
However, these efforts were all conducted with X sound speed conditions.
The approach in this paper, and other related works, was specifically designed to... the recently observed double ducted sound speed profile...
For convenience, we call this phenomena the Beaufort Lens, with the lens referring to ... 

There is no comparable work in the Arctic for a short scale AUV deployment in the Beaufort Lens. 
Both seminal and more recent AUV deployments witnessed the classical upward refracting sound speed profile that is amenable to an isovelocity simplification.
Of note are large scale glider deployments; these, however, operated at X depths, X spatial scales, and did not need precise navigation because they experienced little to no sea ice.
At larger scales on the order of hundreds of kilometers, a deterministic \citep{graupe_preliminary_2019} or through-the-sensor \citep{webster_towards_2015} value for sound speed was used, but error remained in the hundreds of meters.
The sound speed value was chosen by...

The navigation approach proposed includes a non-deterministic relationship between travel time and range previously limited to large scale re-navigation and re-positioning efforts.
Such post-processing efforts can utilize additional information or computation that is inaccessible for onboard computation.

FIG A -- error for MBC/NBC (Oscar Fig 6.17). Think about whether to include separate in situ column. Explain why this section uses error whereas previous section uses correction.

I think if we go down this route, we can take out the GNSS noise section entirely. The POMA paper would go over GNSS noise at high latitudes, crossmap, and look at individual drifts. I do not think the crossmap needs to stay in this publication; given small numerical value of the re-positioning trilateration, I think the same point is made (in a better way, actually).
