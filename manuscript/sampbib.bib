abstract = {The Pacific Arctic Region has experienced decadal changes in atmospheric conditions, seasonal sea-ice coverage, and thermohaline structure that have consequences for underwater sound propagation. To better understand Arctic acoustics, a set of experiments known as the deep-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment and the shallow-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment was conducted in the Canada Basin and on the Chukchi Shelf from summer 2016 to summer 2017. During the experiments, low-frequency signals from five tomographic sources located in the deep basin were recorded by an array of hydrophones located on the shelf. Over the course of the yearlong experiment, the surface conditions transitioned from completely open water to fully ice-covered. The propagation conditions in the deep basin were dominated by a subsurface duct; however, over the slope and shelf, the duct was seen to significantly weaken during the winter and spring. The combination of these surface and subsurface conditions led to changes in the received level of the sources that exceeded 60 dB and showed a distinct spacio-temporal dependence, which was correlated with the locations of the sources in the basin. This paper seeks to quantify the observed variability in the received signals through propagation modeling using spatially sparse environmental measurements.},

abstract = {Climate induced changes in the Arctic Ocean have severely impacted underwater acoustic communication and navigation; understanding underwater noise characteristics is critical to improving the performance of these operations. Ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea recorded in experiments more than 20 years apart (SIMI94 and ICEX16) are compared to determine differences that may be attributed to the region's rapidly changing environment. Spectral comparison shows noise within 20–350 Hz is ∼30 dB louder in 1994 than 2016; however, this is likely due to higher array self noise during SIMI94. Beamforming results show ambient noise vertical directionality is focused near the horizontal during SIMI94 but more spread in elevation during ICEX16, with a robust noise notch at the horizontal. Numerical modeling demonstrates that this difference may be attributed to ambient noise during ICEX16 being dominated by surface noise sources at discrete ranges rather than the historical assumption of a continuous and uniform distribution of sources. Temporal statistics of transient ice events show more acoustic activity during SIMI94 than ICEX16 and appear to support the new proposed surface source distribution for ICEX16.},

abstract = {Underwater ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea, collected in March 2016, is analyzed to investigate the effect that environmental changes in the region have on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ice-generated ambient noise. In particular, the influx of warm Pacific water, so called the Beaufort Lens, has dramatically altered the level and vertical directionality of ambient noise, creating a low noise zone in the ∼75–250 m depth interval with a noise notch at low grazing angles. It is also demonstrated how the observed noise vertical directionality is consistent with ice-mechanical activity along an active pressure ridge ∼30–50 km from the recording array, as shown by satellite imagery. The discrete ranges to this ice activity explain the peak arrival angles between −10 to −15 degrees in noise vertical directionality, as well as the horizontal noise notch. Transient noise events associated with the ice activity are analyzed using an image processing approach with hierarchical clustering applied to the recorded spectrograms. The observed events are grouped into three categories—short-time-broadband, long-time-narrowband, and long-time-broadband—each likely generated through a different mechanism by the ice cover. The spectral and temporal distribution of these transients are discussed.},

@article{Claus2018,
abstract = {This paper extends the progress of single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) range measurements for constraining XY position for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Traditional navigation algorithms have used OWTT measurements to constrain an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). These methodologies limit AUV applications to where DVL bottom-lock is available as well as the necessity for expensive strap-down sensors, such as the DVL. Thus, deep water, mid-water column research has mostly been left untouched, and vehicles that need expensive strap-down sensors restrict the possibility of using multiple AUVs to explore a certain area. This work presents a solution for accurate navigation and localization using a vehicle's odometry determined by its dynamic model velocity and constrained by OWTT range measurements from a topside source beacon as well as other AUVs operating in proximity. We present a comparison of two navigation algorithms: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle Filter(PF). Both of these algorithms also incorporate a water velocity bias estimator that further enhances the navigation accuracy and localization. Closed-loop online field results on local waters as well as a real-time implementation of two days field trials operating in Monterey Bay, California during the Keck Institute for Space Studies oceanographic research project prove the accuracy of this methodology with a root mean square error on the order of tens of meters compared to GPS position over a distance traveled of multiple kilometers.},

abstract = {Acoustic positioning systems typically use the first acoustic arrival from each beacon to determine ranges to known beacon locations, and subsequent multipath arrivals are blanked out. As long as the first arrival is reliably present, these systems are dependable, but in many realistic positioning scenarios, the expected first arrival may be blocked by underwater obstacles or masked by noise. If a subsequent multipath arrival is mistaken for the missing first arrival, a position error will result. This paper presents a positioning system which uses the full multipath structure of the received signal to make the system robust to the fading of individual arrivals. The system determines its position by a two-step process. First, the detected arrivals in the multipath structure are identified with physical ray paths through the environment using a new algorithm which is robust to the disappearance of a subset of the predicted and measured arrivals. Then, the differences in arrival times between the measured arrivals and the predicted ray arrivals are used in a linear inversion to produce a position estimate. The operation of the system is simulated in a typical coastal environment where arrivals become unexpectedly absent due to blocking by unknown bottom topography, and where a high ambient noise level often produces missed arrivals and false detections.},

abstract = {A one-year ﬁxed-path observation of seasonally varying subsurface ducted sound propagation in the Beaufort Sea is presented. The ducted and surface-interacting sounds have different time behaviors. To understand this, a surfaceforced computational model of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas with ice cover is used to simulate local conditions, which are then used to computationally simulate sound propagation. A sea ice module is employed to grow/melt ice and to transfer heat and momentum through the ice. The model produces a time- and space-variable duct as observed, with Paciﬁc Winter Water (PWW) beneath a layer of Paciﬁc Summer Water (PSW) and above warm Atlantic water. In the model, PSW moves northward from the Alaskan coastal area in late summer to strengthen the sound duct, and then mean PSW temperature decreases during winter and spring, reducing the duct effectiveness, one cause of a duct annual cycle. Spatially, the modeled PSW is strained and ﬁlamentary, with horizontally structured temperature. Sound simulations (order 200 Hz) suggest that ducting is interrupted by the intermittency of the PSW (duct gaps), with gaps enabling loss from ice cover (set constant in the sound model). The gaps and ducted sound show seasonal tendencies but also exhibit random process behavior. VC 2021 Acoustical Society of America.},

The current OAT approach is shown to be a special case of the general framework. The matched-field tomography (MFT) approach is also discussed within this context. A simple implementation of this novel approach is then investigated in the absence of a suitable oceanographic model, and acoustic propagation is accounted for using a standard parabolic equation model. The inverse equations derived are validated numerically through a simple inversion example, and some issues on environmental mismatch and computations are discussed.

A global-positioning-system ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor (GISTM) receiver (model GSV4004A) was used to record scintillations and the total electron content (TEC). The polar ionosphere is more sensitive to phase than to amplitude scintillations. Occurrence of amplitude scintillation is confined to well-defined regions, while phase scintillation shows a strong characterization both in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time. Occurrence of amplitude and phase scintillation increases during disturbed compared with quiet days. During disturbed days, the phase-scintillation region is displaced towards lower latitudes, following the auroral oval. The observed noon peak in scintillation occurrence may indicate that the irregularities that generate scintillation are caused by precipitation in the daytime cusp/cleft region. A significant enhancement of the TEC and the rate of change of the TEC index (ROTI) signified transits of polar-cap patches across different satellite trajectories during geomagnetic storms. We found that patches are most likely to occur when IMF Bz is southward and/or Kp{\textgreater}4. Loss of signal lock was more for the L2 signal than for L1, and shows a maximum in the morning sector. Positional errors tend to increase during disturbed conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. and NIPR.},

abstract = {Acoustics play a central role in mankind's interactions with the ocean and the life within. Passive listening to ocean "soundscapes" informs us about the physical and bio-acoustic environment from earthquakes to communication between fish. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to fisheries and biodiversity related interests. The two together in a multi-purpose network can lead to discovery and improve understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, and marine hazards and maritime safety. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of sound generated and utilized by marine life as well as other natural (wind, rain, ice, seismics) and anthropogenic (shipping, surveys) sources, has dramatically increased worldwide to enhance understanding of ecological processes. Characterizing ocean soundscapes (the levels and frequency of sound over time and space, and the sources contributing to the sound field), temporal trends in ocean sound at different frequencies, distribution and abundance of marine species that vocalize, and distribution and amount of human activities that generate sound in the sea, all require passive acoustic systems. Acoustic receivers are now routinely acquiring data on a global scale, e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System hydroacoustic arrays, various regional integrated ocean observing systems, and some profiling floats. Judiciously-placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed PAM and other systems provide: 1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability, taking advantage of the inherent integrating nature of acoustic travel-time data using tomography; and 2) acoustic positioning ("underwater GPS") and communication services enabling basin-scale undersea navigation and management of floats, gliders, and AUVs. This will be especially valuable in polar regions with ice cover. Routine deployment of sources during repeat global-scale hydrographic ship surveys would provide high spatial coverage snapshots of ocean temperatures. To fully exploit the PAM systems, precise timing and positioning need to be broadly implemented. Ocean sound is now a mature Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) "essential ocean variable", which is one crucial step toward providing a fully integrated global multi-purpose ocean acoustic observing system.},

abstract = {The recent Arctic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to the Arctic Ocean's Gakkel Ridge (July/August 2007) aboard the Swedish icebreaker I/B Oden employed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for water-column and ocean bottom surveys. These surveys were unique among AUV operations to date in requiring georeferenced navigation in proximity to the seafloor beneath permanent and moving ice cover. We report results for long-baseline (LBL) acoustic navigation during autonomous under-ice surveys near the seafloor and adaptation of the LBL concept for several typical operational situations including navigation in proximity to the ship during vehicle recoveries. Fixed seafloor transponders were free-fall deployed from the ship for deep positioning. The ship's helicopter collected acoustic travel times from several locations to georeference the transponders' locations, subject to the availability of openings in the ice. Two shallow beacons suspended from the ship provided near-surface spherical navigation in ship-relative coordinates. During routine recoveries, we used this system to navigate the vehicles into open water near the ship before commanding them to surface. In cases in which a vehicle was impaired, its position was still determined acoustically through some combination of its acoustic modem, the fixed seafloor transponders, the ship-deployed transponders, and an onboard backup relay transponder. The techniques employed included ranging adapted for a moving origin and hyperbolic navigation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Recently, a new generation of global positioning system (GPS) collars has become available that provides limited daily location fixes, a relatively long battery life, and are low-cost, compared to full-featured GPS collars. However, their performance is untested, and assessing these biases is needed to inform study designs and data analysis protocols. We used stationary tests of 15 Lotek LifeCycle GPS collars-An example of low-feature GPS collars-To measure the accuracy of location fixes. In addition, we deployed Lotek Lifecycle GPS collars on 153 caribou Rangifer tarandus and 24 bison Bison bison in Yukon and Alaska, to assess their field performance. We examined differences among species, sex, location fix schedule, and latitude, on four performance metrics (FSR, 3D-V FSR, DOP and DSR). Stationary trials indicated that mean precision (4.3 ± 4.0 m [SD]) and accuracy (6.0 ± 4.7 m) of location fixes was excellent, and FSR was good (87.2{\%}), albeit both were slightly affected by forest canopy cover. Field performance varied by species and sex. Notably, the mean DSR for male bison was dismal (27.4 ± 24.2{\%}) likely because of their behaviour, and the mean FSR, 3DV-FSR and DOP, for male caribou was poor (FSR = 57.3 ± 2.0{\%}), compared to collars deployed on female caribou (72.2 ± 1.7{\%}) or female bison (77.9 ± 1.4{\%}). We also observed that the VHF transmitters often failed when the collar malfunctioned. Biases in the accuracy and performance of these low-cost GPS collars should be taken into account when designing studies. Researcher's contemplating investing in low-feature GPS collars require information on their 'real-world' performance so that they can decide whether they are appropriate for their intended application. Moreover, researchers need to consider biases in their GPS collar data prior to embarking on field studies and when conducting analyses with the data collected from them.},

abstract = {An automated, easily deployed Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instrument system, developed for deployment on perennial sea ice in the polar oceans to measure changes in upper ocean water properties in all seasons, is described, and representative data from prototype instruments are presented. The ITP instrument consists of three components: a surface subsystem that sits atop an ice floe; a weighted, plastic-jacketed wire-rope tether of arbitrary length (up to 800 m) suspended from the surface element; and an instrumented underwater unit that employs a traction drive to profile up and down the wire tether. ITPs profile the water column at a programmed sampling interval; after each profile, the underwater unit transfers two files holding oceanographic and engineering data to the surface unit using an inductive modem and from the surface instrument to a shore-based data server using an Iridium transmitter. The surface instrument also accumulates battery voltage readings, buoy temperature data, and locations from a GPS receiver at a specified interval (usually every hour) and transmits those data daily. Oceanographic and engineering data are processed, displayed, and made available in near-real time (available online at http://www.whoi.edu/itp). Six ITPs were deployed in the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2006 in the Beaufort gyre with various programmed sampling schedules of two to six one-way traverses per day between 10- and 750-760-m depth, providing more than 5300 profiles in all seasons (as of July 2007). The acquired CTD profile data document interesting spatial variations in the major water masses of the Canada Basin, show the double-diffusive thermohaline staircase that lies above the warm, salty Atlantic layer, measure seasonal surface mixed layer deepening, and document several mesoscale eddies. Augmenting the systems already deployed and to replace expiring systems, an international array of more than one dozen ITPs will be deployed as part of the Arctic Observing Network during the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2007-08) holding promise for more valuable real-time upper ocean observations for operational needs, to support studies of ocean processes, and to facilitate numerical model initialization and validation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

The work is motivated by the desire to obtain cross-shore hydrographic transects that would provide estimates of the transport of relatively dense, salty water from the Chukchi Sea to the Arctic Ocean in winter. The horizontal scales (∼10 km), maximum water depths (∼100 m) and desired measurements (temperature, salinity and velocity vs. depth) in the study region match the capabilities of a small AUV such as the REMUS-100. It was recognized that achieving the science goals would require increasing the range of acoustic navigation and communication as well as developing a robust approach to through-ice deployment and recovery. These needs drove three modifications to the AUV: 1) Incorporation of a lower frequency (10 kHz) transducer and associated hardware for navigation and communication, 2) Addition of special-purpose sensors and hardware in a hull extension module, 3) Development of a homing algorithm utilizing an Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) array in the AUV nose cap.

Unlike previous research expeditions to the Arctic the focus was on high resolution imaging and sampling of the deep seafloor. To accomplish our goals we designed two new Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) named Jaguar and Puma, which performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062m. These AUVs were used in combination with a towed vehicle and a conventional CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) program to characterize the seafloor.

abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic changes, the most apparent being the rapidly reducing extent and thickness of the summer ice cover. As has been well established over prior decades, the environmental acoustics of the ice-covered Arctic is dominated by two major effects: the highly inhomogeneous ice cover, and the monotonically upward refracting sound speed profile, the combination of which forces all sound paths to be exposed to strong scattering loss and the associated loss of coherence. In some portions of the Arctic Ocean, however, a persistent inflow of a shallow ‘tongue' of warm Pacific water has recently been strengthening, which has dramatically altered the acoustic environment, creating a strong acoustic duct between approximately 100 and 200 m depth. This duct has the potential of trapping sound out to significant ranges (80-100 km) without interacting with the ice cover, resulting in much higher coherence and signal preservation. Acoustic noise measurement results collected with a vertically suspended array during ICEX 2016 illustrate the spatial and temporal noise properties in the presence of this acoustic duct at different depths. Comparisons of the ICEX 2016 data are also made with modeled Arctic noise data.},

Results demonstrate that the introduction of multi-frequency and multi-constellation to these systems enables navigation safety in the Arctic. SBAS brings aircraft precision approach as well as precise maritime operations such as mapping.

abstract = {Abstract The RAFOS float is a small neutrally buoyant subsurface order, which, like its big brother the SOFAR float, uses the deep sound (or SOFAR) channel to determine its position as a function of time. Whereas the SOFAR float transmits to moored receivers, the ?12 kg glass pipe RAFOS float listens for accurately timed signals from moored sound sources to determine its position. The acoustic signal detection and norm of data are all handled by a CMOS microprocessor in the float. The data are recovered at the end of its mission when the float surface and telemeters its memory contents to Systeme Argos, a satellite-borne platform location and data collection system. Just a few sound sources provide navigation for an arbitrary number of floats.},

Additionally, the virtual ocean channel simulator is designed to perform in real time by coupling less frequent asynchronous queries to high-fidelity models of the ocean environment and acoustic propagation with frequent pertubation-based updates for the exact position of the simulated AUVs. The results demonstrate the performance of this system using the WHOI Micro-Modem 2 hardware in the virtual ocean environment of the Arctic Beaufort Sea around 73 degrees latitude.

@article{schneider_unified_2010,
abstract = {Successful command and control (C2) of autonomous vehicles poses challenges that are unique to the marine environment, primarily highly restrictive acoustic communications throughput. To address this, the Unified C2 architecture presented here uses a highly compressed short message encoding scheme (Dynamic Compact Control Language or DCCL) to transfer commands and receive vehicle status. DCCL is readily reconfigurable to provide the flexibility needed to change commands on short notice. Furthermore, operation of multiple types of vehicles requires a C2 architecture that is both scalable and flexible to differences among platform hardware and abilities. The Unified C2 architecture uses the MOOS-IvP autonomy system to act as a “backseat driver” of the vehicle. This provides a uniform interface to the control system on all the vehicles. Also, a hierarchical configuration system is used to allow single changes in configuration to propagate to all vehicles in operation. Status data from all vehicles are displayed visually using Google Earth, which also allows a rapid meshing of data from other sources (sensors, automatic identification system, radar, satellites) from within, as well as outside of, the MOOS-IvP architecture. Results are presented throughout from the CCLNET08, SQUINT08, GLINT08, GLINT09, SWAMSI09, and DURIP09 experiments involving robotic marine autonomous surface craft (ASCs) and Bluefin, OceanServer, and NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {This study analyses GPS performance in Yukon's Arctic coast to inform future research that uses this technology in the region. To test this, Telonics GPS collars were placed on stakes during the summers of 2009 and 2010 throughout the region for varying lengths of time. The fix records produced by these collars were then collected and cleaned, leaving 30 samples. Using these records combined with a digital elevation model, eight variables were extracted and analysed in an attempt to find relationships, such that a fix rate could be predicted throughout the landscape. The results indicated that very few strong relationships existed. Densiometer values proved to be the only relationship between an environmental variable and fix rate. Available sky and aspect data produced results that were contrary to those expected. Overall, Telonics Generation 3 collars had extremely high fix rates, high accuracy, and low positional dilution of precision. Moreover, there was little variation in these results. This means that future GPS studies in the region would likely require minimal correction for fix rate bias. However, if corrections were to be made, more data would have to be gathered to ensure the results were statistically sound. The analysis suffered from the limitations of small sample size and low sample variance, among several others. Therefore, future studies should increase the number and diversity of sites tested.},

abstract = {Broadband acoustic source transmissions recorded on Seagliders at ranges up to 700 km are used to estimate subsurface glider position. Because the sources transmitted at 9-min intervals the glider moved appreciably between source receptions. Source-glider ranges estimated from acoustic arrivals were combined using least squares analysis to estimate glider position and velocity during each reception period. The analysis was applied to 387 sets of source transmissions using three different flight models of glider subsurface motion for initial position input values. The offsets between the position estimated from the flight models and the acoustically derived position resulting from the inversions were 600-900-m root mean square (rms) depending upon the model and input parameters. The offsets were tripled if the positions from the flight models were not corrected for a dive-averaged current (DAC). Estimates of a posteriori errors ranged from 78-105-m rms and from 9.1-11.6-cm/s rms for glider position and velocity, respectively. Data residuals were on the order of 50-m rms, a dramatic reduction from 178-m rms, which was documented for the case neglecting the motion of the glider between subsequent source transmissions (Van Uffelen , J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., vol. 134, pp. 3260-3271, 2013). Overall horizontal glider speed was estimated to be approximately 21-cm/s rms.},

abstract = {Four acoustic Seagliders were deployed in the Philippine Sea November 2010 to April 2011 in the vicinity of an acoustic tomography array. The gliders recorded over 2000 broadband transmissions at ranges up to 700 km from moored acoustic sources as they transited between mooring sites. The precision of glider positioning at the time of acoustic reception is important to resolve the fundamental ambiguity between position and sound speed. The Seagliders utilized GPS at the surface and a kinematic model below for positioning. The gliders were typically underwater for about 6.4 h, diving to depths of 1000 m and traveling on average 3.6 km during a dive. Measured acoustic arrival peaks were unambiguously associated with predicted ray arrivals. Statistics of travel-time offsets between received arrivals and acoustic predictions were used to estimate range uncertainty. Range (travel time) uncertainty between the source and the glider position from the kinematic model is estimated to be 639 m (426 ms) rms. Least-squares solutions for glider position estimated from acoustically derived ranges from 5 sources differed by 914 m rms from modeled positions, with estimated uncertainty of 106 m rms in horizontal position. Error analysis included 70 ms rms of uncertainty due to oceanic sound-speed variability.},

abstract = {This paper describes an acoustic navigation system that provides mesoscale coverage (hundreds of kilometers) under the ice and presents results from the first multi-month deployment in the Arctic. The hardware consists of ice-tethered acoustic navigation beacons transmitting at 900 Hz that broadcast their latitude and longitude plus several bytes of optional control data. The real-time under-ice navigation algorithm, based on a Kalman filter, uses time-of-flight measurements from these sources to simultaneously estimate vehicle position and depth-averaged local currents. The algorithm described herein was implemented on Seagliders, a type of autonomous underwater glider (AUG), but the underlying theory is applicable to other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As part of an extensive field campaign from March to September 2014, eleven acoustic sources and four Seagliders were deployed to monitor the seasonal melt of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and northern Chukchi Seas. Beacon-to-beacon performance was excellent due to a sound duct at 100 m depth where the transmitters were positioned; the travel-time error at 200 km has a standard deviation of 40 m when sound-speed is known, and ranges in excess of 400 km were obtained. Results with the Seagliders, which were not regularly within the duct, showed reliable acoustic ranges up to 100 km and more sparse but repeatable range measurements to over 400 km. Navigation results are reported for the real-time algorithm run in post-processing mode, using data from a 295-hour segment with significant time spent under ice.},

abstract = {This study identifies general characteristics of methods to estimate the absolute range between an acoustic transmitter and a receiver in the deep ocean. The data are from three days of the PhilSea10 experiment with a single fixed transmitter depth (∼998 m) and 150 receiver depths (∼210–5388 m) of known location, and a great-circle transmitter-receiver distance of ∼510 km. The proposed ranging methods compare observed acoustic records with synthetic records computed through the HYCOM (hybrid coordinate ocean model) model. More than 8900 transmissions over 3 days characterize the statistical variation of range errors. Reliable ranging methods de-emphasize the parts of the data records least likely to be reproduced by the synthetics, which include arrival amplitudes, the later parts of the acoustic records composed of nearly horizontally launched rays (i.e., the finale), and waves that sample a narrow span of ocean depths. The ranging methods proposed normalize amplitudes, measure travel times, or reject parts of the waveforms beyond a critical time. All deliver reliable range estimates based on the time and path-averaged HYCOM model, although the final method performs best. The principles behind these methods are transportable and expected to provide reliable range estimates in different deep water settings.},
