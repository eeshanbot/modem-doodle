	abstract = {Natural seepage from the seafloor is a worldwide phenomenon but quantitative measurements of gas release are rare, and the entire range of the dynamics of gas release in space, time, and strength remains unclear so far. To mitigate this, the hydroacoustic device GasQuant (180 kHz, multibeam) was developed to monitor the tempo-spatial variability of gas bubble releases from the seafloor. GasQuant was deployed in 2005 on the seafloor of the seep field Tommeliten (North Sea) for 36 h. This in situ approach provides much better spatial and temporal resolution of seeps than using conventional ship-born echo sounders. A total of 52 gas vents have been detected. Detailed time series analysis revealed a wide range of gas release patterns ranging from very short periodic up to 50 min long-lasting events. The bulk gas seepage in the studied area is active for more than 70\% of observation time. The venting clearly exhibits tidal control showing a peak in the second quarter of the tidal pressure cycle, where pressure drops fastest. The hydroacoustic results are compared with video observations and bubble flux estimates from remotely operated vehicle dives described in the literature. An advanced approach for identifying and visualizing rising bubbles in the sea by hydroacoustics is presented in which water current data were considered. Realizing that bubbles are moved by currents helps to improve the detection of gas bubbles in the data, better discriminate bubbles against fish echoes, and to enhance the S/N ratio in the per se noisy acoustic data.},

	abstract = {Detailed acoustic investigation of bubble streams rising from the seafloor were conducted during R/V Meteor cruise M72/3a at a deep submarine hydrocarbon seep environment. The area is located offshore Georgia (eastern part of the Black Sea) at a water depth between 840 m and 870 m. The sediment echosounder Parasound DS-3/P70 was used for detecting bubbles in the water column that causes strong backscatter in the echographs (“flares”). Employing the swath echsounder Kongsberg EM710 flares in the water column were mapped along the entire swath width of approximately 1000 m at high spatial resolution. The exact location of the flares could be extracted manually. Subsequently, the horizontally looking sonar Kongsberg digital telemetry MS1000 mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) was utilized to quantify the flux of bubbles. A model was developed that is based on the principle of finding the “acoustic mass” in order to quantify the bubble flux at various seeps. The acoustic approach from the backscatter data of the ROV sonar resulted in bubble fluxes in the range of 0.01 to 5.5 L/min (corresponding to 0.037 to 20.5 mol CH4/min) at in situ conditions (∼850 m water depth, ∼9°C). Independent flux estimations using a funnel-shaped device showed that the acoustic model consistently produced lower values but the offset is less than 12\%. Furthermore, the deviation decreased with increasing flux rates. A field of bubble streams was scanned three times from different directions in order to reveal the reproducibility of the method. Flux estimations yielded consistent fluxes of about 2 l/min (7.4 mol CH4/min) with variations of less than 10\%. Although gas emissions have been found at many sites at the seafloor in a range of geological settings, the amount of escaping gas is still largely unknown. With this study presenting a novel method of quantifying bubble fluxes employing a horizontally looking sonar system, it is intended to contribute to the global effort of better constraining bubble fluxes at deep-sea settings.},

We find that the leading two modes are well correlated with an index of the meridional overturning circulation (MOC) on decadal timescales, with the leading mode alone accounting for 54\% of the decadal variance. Episodes of coherent oscillations in the sub-space of the leading EOFs are identified; these episodes are of great interest for the predictability of the THC, and could indicate the existence of different regimes of natural variability. The mechanism identified for the multi-decadal variability is an internal ocean mode, dominated by changes in convection in the Nordic Seas, which lead the changes in the MOC by a few years. Variations in salinity transports from the Arctic and from the North Atlantic are the main feedbacks which control the oscillation. This mode has a weak feedback onto the atmosphere and hence a surface climatic influence. Interestingly, some of these climate impacts lead the changes in the overturning. There are also similarities to observed multi-decadal climate variability.},

The stronger method is further demonstrated on a number of examples covering multi-vehicle and multi-day path planning, based on simulations for the Monterey Bay region.

The coupling of a data-assimilative nested ocean modeling system with an acoustic propagation modeling system was carried out at sea for the first time, within the scope of Battlespace Preparation 2007 (BP07) that was part of Marine Rapid Environmental Assessment (MREA07) exercises. The littoral region for our studies was southeast of the island of Elba ( Italy) in the Tyrrhenian basin east of Corsica and Sardinia. During BP07, several vessels collected in situ ocean data,. based in part on recommendations from oceanographic forecasts. The data were assimilated into a fourdimensional high-resolution ocean modeling system. Sound-speed forecasts were then used as inputs for bearing- and range-dependent acoustic propagation forecasts. Data analyses are carried out and the set-up of the coupled oceanographic-acoustic system as well as the results of its real-time use are described. A significant finding is that oceanographic variability can considerably influence acoustic propagation properties, including the probability of detection, even in this apparently quiet region around Elba. This strengthens the importance of coupling at-sea acoustic modeling to real-time ocean forecasting. Other findings include the challenges involved in downscaling basin-scale modeling systems to high-resolution littoral models, especially in the Mediterranean Sea. Due to natural changes, global human activities and present model resolutions, the assimilation of synoptic regional ocean data is recommended in the region. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Variabilities in the coastal ocean environment span a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. From an acoustic viewpoint, the limited oceanographic measurements and today's ocean computational capabilities are not always able to provide oceanic-acoustic predictions in high-resolution and with enough accuracy. Adaptive Rapid Environmental Assessment (AREA) is an adaptive sampling concept being developed in connection with the emergence of Autonomous Ocean Sampling Networks and interdisciplinary ensemble predictions and adaptive sampling via Error Subspace Statistical Estimation (ESSE). By adaptively and optimally deploying in situ sampling resources and assimilating these data into coupled nested ocean and acoustic models, AREA can dramatically improve the estimation of ocean fields that matter for acoustic predictions. These concepts are outlined and a methodology is developed and illustrated based on the Focused Acoustic Forecasting-05 (FAF05) exercise in the northern Tyrrhenian sea. The methodology first couples the data-assimilative environmental and acoustic propagation ensemble modeling. An adaptive sampling plan is then predicted, using the uncertainty of the acoustic predictions as input to an optimization scheme which finds the parameter values of autonomous sampling behaviors that optimally reduce this forecast of the acoustic uncertainty. To compute this reduction, the expected statistics of unknown data to be sampled by different candidate sampling behaviors are assimilated. The predicted-optimal parameter values are then fed to the sampling vehicles. A second adaptation of these parameters is ultimately carried out in the water by the sampling vehicles using onboard routing, in response to the real ocean data that they acquire. The autonomy architecture and algorithms used to implement this methodology are also described. Results from a number of real-time AREA simulations using data collected during the Focused Acoustic Forecasting (FAF05) exercise are presented and discussed for the case of a single Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). For FAF05, the main AREA-ESSE application was the optimal tracking of the ocean thermocline based on ocean-acoustic ensemble prediction, adaptive sampling plans for vertical Yo-Yo behaviors and subsequent onboard Yo-Yo routing. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

New broadband methods for resonance classification and high-resolution imagery of fish with swimbladders using a modified commercial broadband echosounder. - ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 365-378. A commercial acoustic system, originally designed for seafloor applications, has been adapted for studying fish with swimbladders. The towed system contains broadband acoustic channels collectively spanning the frequency range 1.7-100 kHz, with some gaps. Using a pulse-compression technique, the range resolution of the echoes is [∼]20 and 3 cm in the lower and upper ranges of the frequencies, respectively, allowing high-resolution imaging of patches and resolving fish near the seafloor. Measuring the swimbladder resonance at the lower frequencies eliminates major ambiguities normally associated with the interpretation of fish echo data: (i) the resonance frequency can be used to estimate the volume of the swimbladder (inferring the size of fish), and (ii) signals at the lower frequencies do not depend strongly on the orientation of the fish. At-sea studies of Atlantic herring demonstrate the potential for routine measurements of fish size and density, with significant improvements in accuracy over traditional high-frequency narrowband echosounders. The system also detected patches of scatterers, presumably zooplankton, at the higher frequencies. New techniques for quantitative use of broadband systems are presented, including broadband calibration and relating target strength and volume-scattering strength to quantities associated with broadband signal processing.},

With this motivation, a high-frequency broadband scattering system has been developed for investigating zooplankton and microstructure, involving custom modifications of a commercially available system, with almost complete acoustic coverage spanning the frequency range 150–600 kHz. This frequency range spans the Rayleigh-to- geometric scattering transition for some zooplankton, as well as the diffusive roll-off in the spectrum for scattering from turbulent temperature microstructure. The system has been used to measure scattering from zooplankton and microstructure in regions of non-linear internal waves. The broadband capabilities of the system provide a continuous frequency response of the scattering over a wide frequency band, and improved range resolution and signal-to-noise ratios through pulse-compression signal-processing techniques. System specifications and calibration procedures are outlined and the system performance is assessed.

Model predictions, based on profiles from four locations, indicate that scattering from oceanic pycnoclines is measurable using standard scientific sonars operating at frequencies up to 200 kHz but generally only for pycnocline thicknesses less than 10 m. Accurate scattering models are key to assessing whether acoustic remote sensing can be used to map oceanic pycnoclines and for determining whether scattering from pycnoclines needs to be taken into account when estimating, for instance, zooplankton abundance from acoustic data.},

	abstract = {Distinct frequency dependencies of the acoustic backscattering by zooplankton of different anatomical groups have been observed in our previous studies [Chu et al., ICES J. Mar. Sci. 49, 97-106 (1992); Stanton et al., ICES J. Mar. Sci. 51, 505- 512 (1994)]. Based mainly on the spectral information, scattering models have been proposed to describe the backscattering mechanisms of different zooplankton groups [Stanton et al., J. Acoust. Sec. Am. 103, 236-253 (1998b)]. In this paper, an in-depth study of pulse compression (PC) techniques is presented to characterize the temporal, spectral, and statistical signatures of the acoustic backscattering by zooplankton of different gross anatomical classes. Data collected from various sources are analyzed and the results are consistent with our acoustic models. From compressed pulse (CP) outputs for all three different zooplankton groups, two major arrivals from different parts of the animal body can be identified: a primary and a secondary arrival. (1) Shrimplike animals (Euphausiids and decapod shrimp; near broadside incidence only): the primary one is from the front interface (interface closest to the transducer) of the animal and the secondary arrival is from the back interface; (2) gas-bearing animals (Siphonophores): the primary arrival is from the gas inclusion and the secondary arrival is from the body tissue (”local acoustic center of mass”); and (3) elastic shelled animals (Gastropods): the primary one is from the front interface and the secondary arrival corresponds to the subsonic Lamb wave that circumnavigates the surface of the shell. Statistical analysis of these arrivals is used to successfully infer the size of the individual animals. In conjunction with different aspects of PC techniques explored in this paper, a concept of partial wave target strength (PWTS) is introduced to describe scattering by the different CP highlights. Furthermore, temporal gating of the CP output allows rejection of unwanted signals, improves the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the spectra of selected partial waves of interest, and provides a better understanding of the scattering mechanism of the animals. In addition, it is found that the averaged PWTS can be used to obtain a more quantitative scattering characterization for certain animals such as siphonophores.

	abstract = {When calibrating a broadband active acoustic system with a single standard target such as a sphere, the inherent resonances associated with the scattering by the sphere pose a significant challenge. In this paper, a method is developed which completely eliminates the source of resonances through isolating and exploiting the echo from the front interface of a sphere. This echo is relatively insensitive to frequency over a wide range of frequencies, lacking resonances, and is relatively insensitive to small changes in material properties and, in the case of spherical shells, shell thickness. The research builds upon the concept of using this echo for calibration in the work of Dragonette et al. [J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 69, 1186-1189 (1981)]. This current work generalizes that of Dragonette by (1) incorporating a pulse compression technique to significantly improve the ability to resolve the echo, and (2) rigorously accounting for the scattering physics of the echo so that the technique is applicable over a wide range of frequencies and material properties of the sphere. The utility of the new approach is illustrated through application to data collected at sea with an air-filled aluminum spherical shell and long broadband chirp signals (30-105 kHz).},

	abstract = {Shear instability is the dominant mechanism for converting fluid motion to mixing in the stratified ocean and atmosphere. The transition to turbulence has been well characterized in laboratory settings and numerical simulations at moderate Reynolds number-it involves "rolling up", i.e., overturning of the density structure within the cores of the instabilities. In contrast, measurements in an energetic estuarine shear zone reveal that the mixing induced by shear instability at high Reynolds number does not primarily occur by overturning in the cores; rather it results from secondary shear instabilities within the zones of intensified shear separating the cores. This regime is not likely to be observed in the relatively low Reynolds number flows of the laboratory or in direct numerical simulations, but it is likely a common occurrence in the ocean and atmosphere.

	abstract = {In this paper, measurements of high-frequency broadband (160-590 kHz) acoustic backscattering from surface trapped nonlinear internal waves of depression are presented. These waves are ideal for assessing the contribution from oceanic microstructure to scattering as they are intensely turbulent. Almost coincident direct microstructure measurements were performed and zooplankton community structure was characterized using depth-resolved net sampling techniques. The contribution to scattering from microstructure can be difficult to distinguish from the contribution to scattering from zooplankton using a single narrowband frequency as microstructure and zooplankton are often colocated and can have similar scattering levels over a range of frequencies. Yet their spectra are distinct over a sufficiently broad frequency range, allowing broadband backscattering measurements to reduce the ambiguities typically associated with the interpretation of narrowband measurements. In addition, pulse compression signal processing techniques result in very high-resolution images, allowing physical processes that are otherwise hard to resolve to be imaged, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz shear instabilities. In this study, high-resolution acoustic observations of multiple nonlinear internal waves are presented and regions with distinct scattering spectra are identified. Spectra that decrease in level across the available frequency band were highly correlated to regions of intense turbulence and high stratification, and to Kevin-Helmholtz shear instabilities in particular. Spectra that increase in level across the available frequency band were consistent with scattering dominated by small zooplankton. Simple inversions for relevant microstructure parameters are presented. Limitations of, and improvements to, the broadband system and techniques utilized in this study are discussed.},

	abstract = {Matched field processing (MFP) compares the measures to the modeled pressure fields received at an array of sensors to localize a source in an ocean waveguide. Typically, there are only a few sources when compared to the number of candidate source locations or range-depth cells. We use sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) to learn a common sparsity profile corresponding to the location of present sources. SBL performance is compared to traditional processing in simulations and using experimental ocean acoustic data. Specifically, we localize a quiet source in the presence of a surface interferer in a shallow water environment. This multi-frequency scenario requires adaptive processing and includes modest environmental and sensor position mismatch in the MFP model. The noise process changes likely with time and is modeled as a non-stationary Gaussian process, meaning that the noise variance changes across snapshots. The adaptive SBL algorithm models the complex source amplitudes as random quantities, providing robustness to amplitude and phase errors in the model. This is demonstrated with experimental data, where SBL exhibits improved source localization performance when compared to the white noise gain constraint (-3 dB) and Bartlett processors.

ML is a broad family of techniques, which are often based in statistics, for automatically detecting and utilizing patterns in data. Relative to conventional acoustics and signal processing, ML is data-driven. Given sufficient training data, ML can discover complex relationships between features and desired labels or actions, or between features themselves. With large volumes of training data, ML can discover models describing complex acoustic phenomena such as human speech and reverberation. ML in acoustics is rapidly developing with compelling results and significant future promise. We first introduce ML, then highlight ML developments in four acoustics research areas: source localization in speech processing, source localization in ocean acoustics, bioacoustics, and environmental sounds in everyday scenes.},

Twenty years ago, the United Nations decided to collectively build what is, in essence, a stethoscope to continuously monitor the oceans in the world for the early detection of the most serious danger to world peace and survival, nuclear explosions (see ctbto.org). The impetus for creating this US\$5 billion global network was to enforce compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This network is designed to locate all types of nuclear tests (in the air, on land, underground, and underwater) to within an area less than 1,000 km 2. The CTBT Organization (CTBTO) coordinates, maintains, and analyzes the data from these International Monitoring System (IMS) hydroacoustic stations along with the data from land-based infrasonic, seismic, and radionuclide detectors. Six remote locations around the globe were chosen for detecting underwater detonations. Each location was instrumented with a set of sensitive hydrophones suspended deep within the ocean, at depths that would crush a submarine hull. The design of these moorings was optimized to measure sound propagating over great distances (see Figure 1 for the anatomy of an IMS hydroacoustic station). The record of ocean sound compiled as a consequence of the mission of the IMS network is a resource of vast potential for researchers in many fields, both for forward-looking and for historical scientific analysis.

Acoustic navigation of Lagrangian floats is regularly carried out by measuring travel times from three fixed stations assuming a known value for the speed of sound. The sound speed is considered here as a variable of the problem to be estimated from the travel-time data simultaneously with the horizontal location of the float. The estimation problem is linearized and solved analytically, and closed-form expressions for the sound-speed estimation errors are derived. Typical acoustic navigation (RAFOS) signals are characterized by limited time resolution (0.2 s) challenging the accuracy of sound-speed estimation, depending on the location of the float with respect to the fixed stations. By exploiting travel-time data from multiple floats, the sound-speed estimation accuracy can be increased, which reflects in higher localization accuracy as well. In the case of a single float improved sound-speed estimates and localization results can be obtained by combining travel-time data from different float locations. Numerical results verify the theoretical error estimates and demonstrate the efficiency of the method.},

	abstract = {© 2016 Author(s). Acoustic tomography systems have been deployed in Fram Strait over the past decade to complement existing observing systems there. The observed acoustic arrival patterns are unusual, however, consisting of a single, broad arrival pulse, with no discernible repeating patterns or individual ray arrivals. The nature of these arrivals is caused by vigorous acoustic scattering from the small-scale processes that dominate ocean variability in Fram Strait. Simple models for internal wave and mesoscale variability were constructed and tailored to match the variability observed by moored thermisters in Fram Strait. The internal wave contribution to variability is weak. Acoustic propagation through a simulated ocean consisting of a climatological sound speed plus mesoscale and internal wave scintillations obtains arrival patterns that match the characteristics of those observed, i.e., pulse width and travel time variation. The scintillations cause a proliferation of acoustic ray paths, however, reminiscent of "ray chaos." This understanding of the acoustic forward problem is prerequisite to designing an inverse scheme for estimating temperature from the observed travel times.},

	abstract = {The Arctic sea ice cover has experienced an unprecedented decline since the late 20 th century. As a result, the feedback of sea ice 5 anomalies to atmospheric circulation has been increasingly evidenced. While the climate models almost consistently reproduce the downward trend of sea ice cover, great dispersion between them still exists. To evaluate the model performance in simulating Arctic sea ice and its potential role in climate change, we constructed a reasonable metric by synthesizing the linear trends and anomalies of the sea ice. We particularly focus on the Barents and Kara seas, where the sea ice anomalies have the greatest potential to feedback the atmosphere. Models can be grouped into three categories according to this criterion. The strong contrast among the multi-model ensemble means in different groups demonstrates the robustness 10 and rationality of this method. The potential factors accounting for the different performance of climate models are further explored. The result shows that the model performance depends more on the ozone datasets prescribed by model rather than on the chemistry representation of ozone.},

	doi = {10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<0722:TTBOAA>2.0.CO;2},
	abstract = {In the context of the Asian-Australian monsoon, the tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO) is defined as the tendency for a relatively strong monsoon to be followed by a relatively weak one, and vice versa. Therefore the TBO is not so much an oscillation, but a tendency for the system to flip-flop back and forth from year to year. The more of these interannual flip-flops or transitions, the more biennial the system. The transitions occur in northern spring for the south Asian or Indian monsoon and in northern fall for the Australian monsoon involving coupled land-atmosphere-ocean processes over a large area of the Indo-Pacific region. There is considerable seasonal persistence from the south Asian to Australian monsoon as noted in previous studies, with a strong south Asian or Indian monsoon tending to precede a strong Australian monsoon and vice versa for weak monsoons. Therefore, transitions from March-May (MAM) to June-September (JJAS) tend to set the system for the next year, with a transition to the opposite sign the following year. Quantifying the role of the conditions that contribute to these transitions in the TBO and their relationship to ENSO is crucial for verifying their accurate representation in models, which should lead to improved seasonal forecast skill. An analysis of observed data shows that the TBO (with roughly a 2-3-yr period) encompasses most ENSO years (with their well-known biennial tendency) as well as additional years that contribute to biennial transitions. Thus the TBO is a fundamental feature of the coupled climate system over the entire Indian-Pacific region. El Niño and La Niña events as well as Indian Ocean SST dipole events are large amplitude excursions of the TBO in the tropical Pacific and Indian Oceans, respectively, associated with coupled ocean dynamics, upper-ocean temperature anomalies, and associated ocean heat content anomalies. Conditions postulated to contribute to TBO transitions involve anomalous Asian land surface temperatures. Pacific and Indian Ocean SST anomalies, and the associated strength of the convective maximum over Australasia. These interannual transition conditions are quantified from singular value decomposition (SVD) analyses on a year-by-year basis using single and cumulative anomaly pattern correlations. This technique takes into account intermittent influences and secular variations in the strength of any particular association in any given year. Anomalous Pacific and Indian Ocean SSTs are the dominant transition conditions in the TBO, with anomalous meridional temperature gradients over Asia a secondary factor. There is an intrinsic coupling of the anomalous strength of the convective maximum in the seasonal cycle over Australasia, surface wind forcing, ocean dynamical response, and associated SST anomalies that feed back to the strength of the convective maximum, and so on. All are tied together by the large-scale east-west circulation, the eastern and western Walker cells, in the atmosphere. By omitting El Niño and La Niña onset years from the analysis, there are similar but lower-amplitude relationships among the transition conditions and Asian-Australian monsoon rainfall. An SST transition in the Pacific is started by surface wind anomalies in the far western equatorial Pacific associated with the Australian monsoon, while an SST transition in the Indian Ocean is started by surface wind anomalies in the western equatorial Indian Ocean associated with the Indian monsoon. This provides successive forcing and response among Indian and Pacific SSTs and the Asian-Australian monsoons half a year apart. The consequent feedback to the monsoon circulation by the SST anomalies results in the TBO.},

Although the forecast model can predict the local large-scale zonal wind anomalies for lead times beyond 4 weeks, predictive skill of the monsoon rainfall anomalies is limited to about 2 weeks.

	abstract = {The present study aims to (a) examine meteorological basis for construction of regional monsoon indices and (b) explore the commonality and differences among tropical regional monsoons, especially the teleconnection and monsoon-ENSO relationship. We show that the area-averaged summer precipitation intensity is generally a meaningful precipitation index for tropical monsoons because it represents very well both the amplitude of annual cycle and the leading mode of year-to-year rainfall variability with a nearly uniform spatial pattern. The regional monsoon circulation indices can be defined in a unified way (measuring monsoon trough vorticity) for seven tropical monsoon regions, viz.: Indian, Australian, western North Pacific, North and South American, and Northern and Southern African monsoons. The structures of the tropical monsoons are commonly characterized by a pair of upper-level double anticyclones residing in the subtropics of both hemispheres; notably the winter hemispheric anticyclone has a barotropic structure and is a passive response. Two types of upper-level teleconnection patterns are identified. One is a zonal wave train emanating from the double anticyclones downstream along the westerly jets in both hemispheres, including Indian, Northern African and Australian monsoons; the other is a meridional wave train emanating from the double anticyclones polewards, such as the South American and western North Pacific monsoons. Over the past 55 years all regional summer monsoons have non-stationary relationship with ENSO except the Australian monsoon. The regional monsoon-ENSO relationship is found to have common changing points in 1970s. The relationships were enhanced for the western North Pacific, Northern African, North American and South American summer monsoons, but weakened for the Indian summer monsoon (with a recovery in late 1990s). Regardless the large regional differences, the monsoon precipitations over land areas of all tropical monsoon regions are significantly correlated with the ENSO, suggesting that ENSO drives global tropical monsoon rainfall variability. These results provide useful guidance for monitoring sub-seasonal to seasonal variations of the regional monsoons currently done at NCEP and for assessment of the climate models' performances in representing regional and global monsoon variability. © 2013 The Author(s).},

In this sense, the ocean behaves like a rain gauge. This simple idea will also contribute to resolving the major discrepancies among rainfall climatologies. Addressing these problems requires a full understanding of complex upper ocean processes such as mixing and advection that balance the net freshwater flux at the surface. The global surface salinity measurement system, including both in situ instruments and satellites, along with regional upper ocean process studies, will soon be in place to advance these studies.},

The index can be used to depict the seasonal cycle (for instance the onset) and measure the intraseasonal, interannual, and interdecadal variations of the Australian monsoon. The interannual variation of the Australian monsoon onset determined by the AUSMI agrees well with that derived from the rainfall and winds at Darwin in the previous studies. We found a signiicant anti-correlation between the monsoon onset date and the seasonal (DJF) mean AUSMI anomalies; namely an early onset is accompanied by a strong Australian summer monsoon and vice versa. These interannual variations are also strongly associated with El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In contrast, the retreat dates are not significantly different between the strong and weak Australian summer monsoon years. The AUSMI is useful in monitoring the weather and climate variations of the Australian monsoon and validating the performance of climate models. © 2009 Royal Meteorological Society.},

Future climate warming could alter these modes of variability. For example, with the warming projected for the end of the twenty-first century, the mean climate of the tropical Indian Ocean is expected to change considerably. These changes have the potential to affect the Indian Ocean Dipole, currently characterized by an alternation of anomalous cooling in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean and warming in the west in a positive dipole event, and the reverse pattern for negative events. The amplitude of positive events is generally greater than that of negative events. Mean climate warming in austral spring is expected to lead to stronger easterly winds just south of the Equator, faster warming of sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean compared with the eastern basin, and a shoaling equa- torial thermocline. The mean climate conditions that result from these changes more closely resemble a positive dipole state. However, defined relative to the mean state at any given time, the overall frequency of events is not projected to change — but we expect a reduction in the difference in amplitude between positive and negative dipole events.},

However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima experiments) and the CMIP Historical Simulation (1850–near-present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP, (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble, and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and the CMIP Historical Simulation to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP Historical Simulation, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. The participation in the CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs will be at the discretion of the modelling groups, and will depend on scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions: (i) how does the Earth system respond to forcing?, (ii) what are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?, and (iii) how can we assess future climate changes given climate variability, predictability and uncertainties in scenarios? This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and the CMIP6 Historical Simulation, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

CMIP needs to create a scien�tific framework for a set of coordinated multimodel experiments designed to increase our understanding of the climate system. At the same time CMIP needs to remain relevant to the broader climate change community. CMIP5 incorporated new paradigms for developing future emission scenarios, introduced experiments to explore carbon climate interactions, and used high-resolution atmosphere-only models to provide more detailed regional climate change information. The future climate change problem was defined by time scale in terms of near-term and long-term. A survey of the various parts of the climate community subsequent to CMIP5 and the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC revealed a number of challenges and gaps in the CMIP5 process. Poor quantification and understanding of radiative forcing have been a long-standing problem within CMIP and will be revisited with new approaches in CMIP6, including more coordinated representation of the atmospheric aerosol and land surface processes and much more detailed online and offline intercomparison activities. The problems of comparing models to observations when the signals are small relative to the natural climatic variability, as well as trying to understand and predict the variability on longer than annual time scales will also be addressed in CMIP6. CMIP6 will consist of individual CMIP6-endorsed MIPs that focus on specific scientific themes.},

	abstract = {Ocean reanalyses combine ocean models, atmospheric forcing fluxes, and observations using data assimilation to give a four-dimensional description of the ocean. Metrics assessing their reliability have improved over time, allowing reanalyses to become an important tool in climate services that provide a more complete picture of the changing ocean to end users. Besides climate monitoring and research, ocean reanalyses are used to initialize sub-seasonal to multi-annual predictions, to support observational network monitoring, and to evaluate climate model simulations. These applications demand robust uncertainty estimates and fit-for-purpose assessments, achievable through sustained advances in data assimilation and coordinated inter-comparison activities. Ocean reanalyses face specific challenges: i) dealing with intermittent or discontinued observing networks, ii) reproducing inter-annual variability and trends of integrated diagnostics for climate monitoring, iii) accounting for drift and bias due e.g. to air-sea flux or ocean mixing errors, iv) optimizing initialization and improving performances during periods and in regions with sparse data. Other challenges such as multi-scale data assimilation to reconcile mesoscale and large-scale variability and flow-dependent error characterization for rapidly evolving processes, are amplified in long-term reanalyses. The demand to extend reanalyses backward in time requires tackling all these challenges, especially in the emerging context of earth system reanalyses and coupled data assimilation. This mini-review aims at documenting recent advances from the ocean reanalysis community, discussing unsolved challenges that require sustained activities for maximizing the utility of ocean observations, supporting data rescue and advancing specific research and development requirements for reanalyses.},

	abstract = {© 2019 Author(s). A superhydrophobic surface is non-sticking to aqueous droplets due to minimized solid-liquid contact, but the small contact area also poses challenges to droplet maneuvering. This letter reports a technique using electric field gradients to actuate aqueous droplets on superhydrophobic surfaces. A pin-ring electrode pair underneath the insulating superhydrophobic surface is used to generate electric field gradient above the surface, with the field focused around the pin. The non-uniform field operates on the electrostatically induced charges on the droplet, producing an actuation force attracting the droplet toward the pin. The actuation force is proportional to the square of the imposed field as shown in both experiments and simulations. This non-contact actuation technique is effective in electrostatically trapping and translating superhydrophobic droplets, despite the small solid-liquid contact. The pin-ring configuration can be readily extended to a pin array between two parallel lines, which essentially form a stretched ring closing at infinity. The pin array is used to demonstrate individual actuation of two droplets leading to their eventual coalescence.},

Faster flow of outlet glaciers has substantially contributed to this loss, with the cause of speedup, and potential for future change, uncertain. Here we combine more than three decades of remotely sensed observational products of outlet glacier velocity, elevation, and front position changes over the full ice sheet. We compare decadal variability in discharge and calving front position and find that increased glacier discharge was due almost entirely to the retreat of glacier fronts, rather than inland ice sheet processes, with a remarkably consistent speedup of 4-5\% per km of retreat across the ice sheet. We show that widespread retreat between 2000 and 2005 resulted in a step-increase in discharge and a switch to a new dynamic state of sustained mass loss that would persist even under a decline in surface melt.},

We study this question in the context of teachers' bias in grading immigrants and native children in middle schools. Teachers give lower grades to immigrant students compared to natives who have the same performance on standardized, blindly-graded tests. We then relate differences in grading to teachers' stereotypes, elicited through an Implicit Association Test (IAT). We find that math teachers with stronger stereotypes give lower grades to immigrants compared to natives with the same performance. Literature teachers do not differentially grade immigrants based on their own stereotypes. Finally, we share teachers' own IAT score with them, randomizing the timing of disclosure around the date on which they assign term grades. All teachers informed of their stereotypes before term grading increase grades assigned to immigrants. Revealing stereotypes may be a powerful intervention to decrease discrimination, but it may also induce a reaction from individuals who were not acting in a biased way.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Under this expanded approach, three quantities are measured from an impulsive sound: the time difference between direct-path arrivals on a forward and rear subarray, the time difference between the direct and surface-reflected paths on the rear subarray, and the acoustic bearing measured on the rear subarray. These quantities, combined with independent measurements of hydrophone depths and cable inclination, are converted into range-depth position fixes by implementing an efficient numerical procedure that uses a ray-tracing code to account for ray-refraction effects caused by depth-dependent sound speed profiles. Analytic expressions that assume a constant waterborne sound speed are also derived. Foraging depths of various sperm whales over 10 days in June, 2004 are estimated using the numerical technique.},

The system provides global thermohaline and sound speed fields on a daily basis using environmental inputs from the U.S. Navy as well as remote sensing of sea surface temperature and sea surface height. To examine the MODAS fields, the authors also used data from the Southern California Bight collected by the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations as well as high-resolution hydrographic data collected over the continental shelf south of New England as part of the shelfbreak PRIMER experiment. MODAS performs well for features such as large-scale boundary currents and eddies but is more limited in resolving features such as shelfbreak and coastal fronts, which have small spatial and temporal correlation scales. Because of the considerable computational needs of other ESME modules and its use as a planning tool, the authors present a pragmatic approach for future applications},

The question posed by HIFT, whether at such global ranges the signals would permit phase-coherent processing and thus yield favorable signal-to-noise levels, was answered in the affirmative. There was no evidence of distress by the local marine mammal population in response to the acoustic transmissions. HIFT was prerequisite to a program for Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC).

This presents a challenge to existing ray-tracing based methods, which are widely adopted to simulate propagation due to their efficiency and flexibility, but assume linear rays. We present a novel algorithm that traces analytic ray curves computed from local media gradients, and utilizes the closed-form solutions of both the intersections of the ray curves with planar surfaces, and the travel distance. By constructing an adaptive unstructured mesh, our algorithm is able to model general media profiles that vary in three dimensions with complex boundaries consisting of terrains and other scene objects such as buildings. We trace the analytic ray curves using the adaptive unstructured mesh, which considerably improves the efficiency over prior methods. We highlight the algorithm's application on simulation of sound and visual propagation in outdoor scenes.},

	abstract = {Sound propagation in 3D spaces is governed by similar physical principles as light. As a result, sound rendering in a 3D virtual environment can benefit from methods developed for graphics rendering and vice versa. In this review, we provide an overview of methods used for sound rendering that share concepts and techniques with graphics rendering. Firstly we describe geometrical propagation techniques where the computations are based on ray theory similar to ray tracing techniques in computer graphics. Secondly, we review numerical techniques. These techniques, similar to the idea of radiosity, are based on the subdivision of the space into elements. Then we describe acceleration techniques that can be used in combination with other methods to speed up calculations. Lastly, for the sake of completeness, a quick overview is given of sound computation techniques that simulate specific sound effects that do not apply on illumination. The aim of this survey is to share knowledge among the two disciplines using familiar and known concepts.},

At scales between 10 and 200 km, the ADCP kinetic energy spectra approximately follow a k−3 power law. The observed flows are more energetic at the surface, but the shape of the kinetic energy spectra is independent of depth. These characteristics resemble predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The ratio of across-track to along-track kinetic energy spectra, however, significantly departs from the expectation of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic turbulence. The inconsistency is dramatic at scales smaller than 40 km. A Helmholtz decomposition of the ADCP spectra and analyses of synthetic and numerical model data show that horizontally divergent, ageostrophic flows account for the discrepancy between the observed spectra and predictions of isotropic interior quasigeostrophic t...},

	abstract = {Recent developments in wireless communication technology combined with significant increases in computing power have opened the way to Acoustically Focused Oceanographic Sampling (AFOS). AFOS consists of a network of acoustic arrays connected to a fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV) and to a shore station using wireless local area network technology. A real-time field estimate of temperature or current in the region of interest is computed by combining the various integral and local data sets available. The real-time field estimate and its associated error field are then used to adaptively direct AUVs towards regions where high resolution is required due to large gradients or large uncertainties. A feasibility experiment was recently performed in Haro Strait, British Columbia (June-July 1996). The novelty of the Haro Strait data set resides in its unusual tomographic features: ranges are short (less than 3 km), sound speed perturbations are small (2 to 3m/s), and currents are relatively strong (up to 5 kts). Operational constraints require that the field inversion be robust and computationally efficient. This thesis makes contributions to both the forward and the inverse problem. Numerically efficient solutions to the windy wave equation are presented in the wavenumber integration and the normal mode approaches using a unified theoretical formulation. Accurate numerical predictions of the acoustic field in the presence of a stratified flow are made using modified versions of the computer codes OASES and KRAKEN. A robust, hybrid linear inversion scheme adapted to the estimation of oceanic fields in coastal environments such as Haro Strait is then developed. Expressions for hybrid field estimates as well as their associated estimate variances are derived. These expressions enable the combination of multiple data streams of global and local nature in a robust and efficient fashion. Inversion performance is subsequently assessed, showing significant gains in coverage and estimated error from the combination of multiple data sets. Signal frequency coherence is shown to be a key asset in the Haro Strait environment. Second-order field statistics are computed, and the position of the Haro Strait front during flood tide on 06/20/96 was estimated.

	abstract = {The use of adjoint modeling for acoustic inversion is investigated. An adjoint model is derived from a linearized forward propagation model to propagate data-model misfit at the observation points back through the medium to the medium perturbations not being accounted for in the model. This adjoint model can be used to aid in inverting for these unaccounted medium perturbations. Adjoint methods are being applied to a variety of inversion problems, but have not drawn much attention from the underwater acoustic community. This paper presents an application of adjoint methods to acoustic inversion. Inversions are demonstrated in simulation for both range-independent and range-dependent sound speed profiles using the adjoint of a parabolic equation model. Sensitivity and error analyses are discussed showing how the adjoint model enables calculations to be performed in the space of observations, rather than the often much larger space of model parameters. Using an adjoint model enables directions of steepest descent in the model parameters ?what we invert for? to be calculated using far fewer modeling runs than if a forward model only were used. © 2004 Acoustical Society of America. ?DOI: 10.1121/1.1636760?},

	abstract = {In a recent experiment (The Ocean Tomography Group, Nature, 299, 121-125, 1982) the sound-speed field (and hence temperature) within an ocean volume was computed from acoustic travel times through the volume along many diverse ray paths, using inverse theory. Here we consider the limits on vertical resolution imposed by the fundamental character of the ocean sound channel. For a standard case we take an axial transmitter and receiver separated by 1000 km, with layers determined by the turning depths of double-looped rays. This gives an underdetermined system of 10 layers and six rays, with a forbidding up-down ambiguity between 'conjugate' layers (two layers with equal sound speed above and beneath the sound axis). The ambiguity can be reduced (but not eliminated) by including rays with an extra upper (or lower) loop, and can be removed by going to a coarse vertical grid. The results apply to the 'agnostic' case where nothing is prescribed; if it can be assumed that the disturbances are N(z) weighted according to WKBJ theory, then the standard 10-layer case is adequately resolved in the upper and axial ocean. If one can prescribe that the disturbance is associated with only the gravest few modes (as found during the MODE expedition), then the results are favourable at all depths. We consider tomography with reciprocal transmissions for obtaining the fields of both particle velocity and sound speed, and we assume that the density perturbations are adequately determined by the sound field using an average T-S relation. The thermal-wind equation relates the vertical velocity gradient to the horizontal density gradient and can be used to impose a constraint on the inversion process, which significantly improves the determination of both fields. The procedure leads to a formalism for objectively separating barotropic and baroclinic velocity fields. © 1982.},

	abstract = {We have measured perturbation of the sound speed δC(x,y,z) (temperature) field within an ocean volume by repeated acoustic transmissions through the volume along many different ray paths i (Ocean Tomography Group, 1982). The data set consisted of ray travel time perturbations δti, and the sound field was obtained by inverse theory from a linear weighted sum δC(x,y,z)=ΣiAi−1 (x,y,z) δti, where Ai is the time spent by ray i in a differential volume centered on x,y,z. Here the method is extended to cases (e.g. the ‘axial' ocean near a sound speed minimum) where ray theory is not applicable or not convenient. This is done by including in the data set the frequency perturbation δf of lower modes. The matrix A is generalized to a combination of ray weighting and mode weighting. The procedures are illustrated for bilinear and quadratic sound channels, corresponding to a last and first arrival, respectively, of the axial ray, and for a cosh z profile (surprisingly close to some measured equatorial sound speed profiles) where all rays arrive together. We use a northwest Atlantic profile for illustration of an actual case, and here we find overlapping arrival sequences which lead to additional complexities. All this is conveniently displayed in frequency-time (ambiguity) diagrams. We discuss two inversion schemes: one based on Abel transforms and the other on numerical matrix inversions. The latter scheme is more straightforward for perturbations from a known initial state. The paper is a review of the underlying principles; application to measurements is planned in the near future.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring ocean basins for mesoscale fluctuations, using acoustic inverse techniques. The procedure, which has much in common with conventional seismology, consists of measuring perturbations in travel time between acoustic sources and receivers. Because the number of pieces of information is the product of the number of sources, receivers, and resolvable multipath arrivals, the economics of the system is enhanced over usual spot measurements. The temporal resolution required to distinguish multipath arrivals is estimated at 50 ms; the precision required to measure mesosclae perturbations is estimated at 25 ms. The required resolution and precision can be achieved by existing low-frequency (100- to 200-Hz) broadband ({\textbackslash}textgreater 20-Hz) sources, but we are ultimately limited to 1000-km ranges by the variable ocean finestructure and associated micropaths. There appear to be no practical range limits imposed by micropaths if such broadband sources could be centered at 30 Hz. Given the travel time measurements and their noise estimates, we show how actually to invert the system for the interior changes in sound speed and, by inference, for density. The method is analogous to the medical procedure called tomography (from the Greek 'slice'). Measures of the spatial resolution and of formal error bars are obtained. We conclude that such a system is achievable now and has potential for development in a number of directions. © 1979.},

The study area was an 80 x 70 km grid east of Bear Island where the front exhibits topographic trapping along the northern slope of the Bear Island Trough. Conductivity-temperature-depth, current meter, and acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data, combined with tomographic cross sections, presented a highly resolved picture of the front in August. All hydrographic measurements were dominated by tidal signals, with the strongest signatures associated with the M2 and S2 semidiurnal species. Mean currents in the warm saline water to the south of the front, derived from a current meter mooring and ADCP data, were directed to the southwest and may be associated with a barotropic recirculation of Norwegian Atlantic Water (NAW) within the Bear Island Trough. The geostrophic component of the velocity was well correlated with the measured southwestward mean surface layer flow north of the front. The frontal structure was retrograde, as the frontal isopleths sloped opposite to the bathymetry. The surface signature of the front was dominated by salinity gradients associated with the confluence of Atlantic and Arctic water masses, both warmed by insolation to a depth of about 20 m. The surface manifestation of the front varied laterally on the order of 10 km associated with tidal oscillations. Below the mixed layer, temperature and salinity variations were compensating, defining a nearly barotropic front. The horizontal scale of the front in this region was —3 km or less. At middepth beneath the frontal interface, tomographic cross sections indicated a high-frequency (—16 cpd) upslope motion of filaments of NAW origin. The summertime BSPF was confirmed to have many of the general characteristics of a shelf-slope frontal system [Mooers et al., 1978] as well as a topographic-circulatory front [Federov, 1983].},

Although the properties of the upper layers of the ocean can be routinely measured on large scales by satellite remote sensing (providing altimetric and infrared data) and with expendable probes dropped from commercial vessels, the deep interior of the ocean is more difficult to monitor. Ocean acoustic tomography is a promising technique for such applications, as it has the potential to provide systematic, istantaneous and repeated measurements of the ocean interior over large parts of an ocean basin.

	abstract = {In the winter of 1991-1992 a convection experiment was conducted in the western Mediterranean Gulf of Lions, combining a variety of observational techniques. An essential component was an acoustic tomography array, consisting of six moorings, designed to observe the time evolution of the large-scale processes believed to be relevant in a convection regime. Here two-dimensional slice inversions in three directions from the central mooring are used to estimate the volume of convected water and the mean convection depth and to observe the preconditioning and restratification processes before and after the convection. The near-surface layer is well sampled by the acoustics, which show cooling and subsequent entrainment of the warmer Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) from below, in agreement with mixed-layer calculations. During the 2 months prior to the main convection event the total heat loss of the large-scale field is in approximate agreement with the surface heat fluxes, showing that little net warm-water advection takes place from outside the convection region. The implied confinement of water by the local circulation should be an important factor in setting the location and extent of the deep convection patch. The volume of water modified by convection in this winter is estimated to correspond to an area of order 60 km radius and 1500 m depth. It is argued that the homogenized area implies an annual mean deep water replenishment of 0.3 Sv. The restratification, by the return of less dense water in the surface and LIW layers, occurs first by rapid capping in the near-surface region. Thereafter, the southern and eastern parts of the region restratify in the deeper layers on a 40-day timescale, while a dense core of 50-60 km diameter remains in the northwest until the end of the experiment.},

	abstract = {BELLHOP is a beam tracing model for predicting acoustic pres- sure fields in ocean environments. The beam tracing structure leads to a particularly simple algorithm. Several types of beams are imple- mented including Gaussian and hat-shaped beams, with both geomet- ric and physics-based spreading laws. BELLHOP can produce a vari- ety of useful outputs including transmission loss, eigenrays, arrivals, and received time-series. It allows for range-dependence in the top and bottom boundaries (altimetry and bathymetry), as well as in the sound speed profile. Additional input files allow the specification of directional sources as well as geoacoustic properties for the bounding media. Top and bottom reflection coefficients may also be provided. BELLHOP is implemented in Fortran,Matlab, and Python and used on multiple platforms (Mac, Windows, and Linux). This report describes the code and illustrates its use. 1},

	abstract = {This report describes a new, flexible computer code in the FORTRAN computer language to make ray calculations for ocean acoustic tomography. The Numerical Recipes software package provided the basis for much of this computer code. The ray equations are reviewed, and ray equations that include the effects of ocean current are derived. Methods are derived for rapidly integrating those equations to obtain time front and eigenray information for long-range, deep-water acoustic transmissions. These methods include a look-up table for sound speed, sound speed gradient, second derivative of sound speed, and range-dependent information. Cubic spline methods are used to interpolate sound speed with depth and to obtain the derivatives of sound speed. The choice of the step size increments used to integrate the equations is a critical aspect of the integration, affecting both the accuracy of the prediction and the speed of computation. A predetermined, user-specified step size appears to allow more efficient calculations than "adaptive step" methods. "Adaptive step" methods adjust the step size automatically to maintain a given accuracy in the integration of the ray equations, while user-specified step sizes allow one to use prior knowledge of the integration problem to achieve the desired accuracy with much less computational overhead. Several integration methods were explored, but the classical 4th order Runge-Kutta method appears to be the most efficient and best method for this integration problem. Appendices describe detailed aspects of the computer code, as well as the methods used for deriving eigenray information and for parallelizing the ray calculations. The computer code is designed to be unstable so that the user can easily modify it to his or her own porpoises.},

Basic issues relating to the feasibility and implementation of atmospheric tomography are discussed. Among these issues are the causes of fluctuations in acoustic signals propagated through the atmosphere, appropriate spatial dimensions of an array, signal detection and processing techniques, mathematical inverse techniques and their numerical implementation, and whether or not tomography m provide measures of dynamical variables of interest to atmospheric scientists. Surface-layer, horizontal-slice tomography was implemented experimentally, with an array of three sources and seven receivers distributed over a region approximately 200 m square. Travel-time fluctuations at the receivers were used to reconstruct the temperature and wind fields with about 50-m resolution in the horizontal plane.},

	abstract = {A new approach for the inversion of travel-time data is proposed, based on the matching between model arrivals and observed peaks. Using the linearized model relations between sound-speed and arrival-time perturbations about a set of background states, arrival times and associated errors are calculated on a fine grid of model states discretizing the sound-speed parameter space. Each model state can explain (identify) a number of observed peaks in a particular reception lying within the uncertainty intervals of the corresponding predicted arrival times. The model states that explain the maximum number of observed peaks are considered as the more likely parametric descriptions of the reception; these model states can be described in terms of mean values and variances providing a statistical answer (matched-peak solution) to the inversion problem. A basic feature of the matched-peak inversion approach is that each reception can be treated independently, i.e., no constraints are posed from previous-reception identification or inversion results. Accordingly, there is no need for initialization of the inversion procedure and, furthermore, discontinuous travel-time data can be treated. The matched-peak inversion method is demonstrated by application to 9-month-long travel-time data from the Thetis-2 tomography experiment in the western Mediterranean sea.},

	abstract = {An experiment validating the concept of acoustically focused oceanographic sampling (AFOS) was recently implemented in Haro Strait, British Columbia (Canada). Four 16-element vertical receiver arrays were moored around the location of a coastal front driven by estuarine and tidal forcing. Various signals were transmitted from array to array and from a moving source to the arrays over a period of five weeks. Tomographic signals were transmitted over a wide frequency band (150 Hz to 15 kHz). The novelty of the Haro Strait data set resides in its unusual tomographic features: ranges are short (less than 3 km), sound speed perturbations are small (2 to 3 m/s), and currents are relatively strong (3.5 kts). Light-bulb-generated wideband acoustic signals are used in this paper in conjunction with local nonacoustic measurements in order to image the three-dimensional sound speed and current fields within the water mass enclosed by the moored arrays. The combined use of integral and local data leads to a significant decrease of the field estimate uncertainty while maintaining a coverage of the area not achievable by nonacoustic means.},

The system reported herein, which is employed to renavigate the vehicle in post-processing, forms the basis for a vehicle-based real-time navigation system. Existing high-precision absolute navigation techniques for underwater vehicles are impractical over long length scales and lack scalability for simultaneously navigating multiple vehicles. The navigation method reported in this paper relies on a single moving reference beacon, eliminating the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area. The use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from the single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report experimental results from the first deep-water evaluation of this method using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey carried out in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of the navigation fixes provided by the proposed synchronous acoustic navigation system in comparison to navigation fixes obtained by an independent conventional long baseline acoustic navigation system.},

	abstract = {While the study of geometry has mainly concentrated on single viewpoint (SVP) cameras, there is growing attention to more general non-SVP systems. Here, we study an important class of systems that inherently have a non-SVP: a perspective camera imaging through an interface into a medium. Such systems are ubiquitous: They are common when looking into water-based environments. The paper analyzes the common flat-interface class of systems. It characterizes the locus of the viewpoints (caustic) of this class and proves that the SVP model is invalid in it. This may explain geometrical errors encountered in prior studies. Our physics-based model is parameterized by the distance of the lens from the medium interface, besides the focal length. The physical parameters are calibrated by a simple approach that can be based on a single frame. This directly determines the system geometry. The calibration is then used to compensate for modeled system distortion. Based on this model, geometrical measurements of objects are significantly more accurate than if based on an SVP model. This is demonstrated in real-world experiments. In addition, we examine by simulation the errors expected by using the SVP model. We show that when working at a constant range, the SVP model can be a good approximation.},

Equirectangular projections provide a simple, affine mapping between geographic coordinates and the coordinates of a cartesian grid. Additionally, AlvinXY and similar coordinate systems disregard the effect of depth upon the coordinate mapping. Advances in underwater navigational instrumentation during the past forty years now allow localization to such precision that, in some cases, the precision of the navigation solution is comparable to that of errors introduced by working in this simple coordinate space. In this paper, we characterize the effects of projection errors in this system upon vehicle navigation and localization for deep oceanographic vehicles today.},

Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n = 9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions.},

Simultaneous observations of temperature, salinity and the vertical distribution of their principal prey, Calanus finmarchicus stage 5 copepodites (C5), were obtained along each whale's track with a conductivity-temperature-depth instrument (CTD) and an optical plankton counter (OPC). Right whale feeding dives were characterized by rapid descent from the surface to a particular depth between 80 and 175 m, remarkable fidelity to that depth for 5 to 14 min and then rapid ascent back to the surface. The average depth of dive was strongly and positively correlated with both the aver- age depth of peak C. finmarchicus C5 abundance and the average depth of the bottom mixed layer's upper surface. Significantly longer surface intervals were observed for reproductively active females and their calves when compared to other individuals, indicating that this critical segment of the pop- ulation may be at increased risk of ship strikes owing to their diving behavior. Ingestion rates calcu- lated from TDR and OPC data exceeded estimated daily metabolic requirements for most of the tagged right whales; however, short deployment durations and uncertainty in metabolic rates make it impossible to judge whether individual right whales were obtaining sufficient energy to meet the metabolic costs of reproduction. Improvements in attachment durations and the development of novel methods to estimate the metabolic rates of large whales in situ are required to determine whether right whale reproduction is limited by insufficient food resources.},

This sound has been recorded in the Bay of Fundy, Canada from both single whales (n =9) and social surface active groups (n=49). Those single whales producing Gunshot sounds whose sex could be determined (n = 9) were all mature males. Gunshot sounds were produced as part of a stereotyped behavioral sequence by these individuals, including frequent head-lifts and flipper slapping at the surface. In surface active groups, Gunshot sounds were commonly recorded when males were present in the group. The rate of production of Gunshot sounds was weakly correlated with the total number of males present in the group. Given the behavioral context of Gunshot sound production, and production of the sound only by male whales, Gunshots may function in a reproductive context as an advertisement signal to attract females, an agonistic signal directed toward other males, or a combination of the two functions.},

Using a combined vertical and horizontal acoustic receiving array, sei whale movements were tracked over long distances (up to tens of kilometers) using a normal mode back propagation technique. This approach uses low-frequency, broadband passive sei whale call receptions from a single-station, two-dimensional hydrophone array to perform long distance localization and tracking by exploiting the dispersive nature of propagating normal modes in a shallow water environment. The back propagation approach is examined for accuracy and application to tracking the sei whale vocalizations identified in the vertical and horizontal array signals. This passive whale tracking, combined with the intensive oceanography measurements performed during the experiment, was also used to examine sei whale movements in relation to oceanographic features observed in this region.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic monitoring is being used to detect vocalizing marine mammals. Data on call types and individual rates of sound production are necessary to use passive acoustics to identify species, assess individual detectability, and estimate the number of individuals present. The present study describes the sound production behavior of endangered North Atlantic right whales Eubalaena glacialis in the Bay of Fundy, Canada, during July and August, recorded with suction cup archival tags (Dtag) in 2000 to 2002 and 2005. The Dtag simultaneously recorded acoustic data from a hydrophone along with the depth and orientation of the whale. Over 168 h of acoustic data were obtained from 46 tag deployments (35 ind.), with an average attachment duration of 4.5 h. The rate of sound production was variable, ranging from 0 to 200 calls h−1 (mean ± SD: 6.4 ± 29.8 calls h−1), with 28 of the 46 tagged whales producing no calls (corresponding to 69/168 h of data). Right whale sounds from any whale in the area were recorded on most tag records, indicating that aggregations of whales may be detected more reliably than individuals. Calling rates were highest during surface activity and traveling and lowest during foraging and logging behavior. Whales of both sexes and all age-classes produced upcalls and other tonal calls, and 1 adult male produced gunshot sounds. The present study provides insight from the largest extant collection of recordings of individual North Atlantic right whales into the acoustic detectability of individual right whales and demonstrates that the behavioral state is the primary factor affecting calling rate.},

	abstract = {Passive acoustic tracking provides an unobtrusive method of studying the movement of sound-producing animals in the marine environment where traditional tracking methods may be costly or infeasible. We used passive acoustic tracking to characterize the fine-scale movements of singing humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground. Male humpback whales produce complex songs, a phenomenon that is well documented in tropical regions during the winter breeding season, but also occurs at higher latitudes during other times of year. Acoustic recordings were made throughout 2009 using an array of autonomous recording units deployed in the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Song was recorded during spring and fall, and individual singing whales were localized and tracked throughout the array using a correlation sum estimation method on the time-synchronized recordings. Tracks were constructed for forty-three song sessions, revealing a high level of variation in movement patterns in both the spring and fall seasons, ranging from slow meandering to faster directional movement. Tracks were 30 min to 8 h in duration, and singers traveled distances ranging from 0.9 to 20.1 km. Mean swimming speed was 2.06 km/h (SD 0.95). Patterns and rates of movement indicated that most singers were actively swimming. In one case, two singers were tracked simultaneously, revealing a potential acoustic interaction. Our results provide a first description of the movements of singers on a northwest Atlantic feeding ground, and demonstrate the utility of passive acoustic tracking for studying the fine-scale movements of cetaceans within the behavioral context of their calls. These methods have further applications for conservation and management purposes, particularly by enhancing our ability to estimate cetacean densities using passive acoustic monitoring.},

	title = {Tracking marine mammals using passive acoustics},
	abstract = {It is difficult to study the behavior and physiology of marine mammals or to understand and mitigate human impact on them because much of their lives are spent underwater. Since sound propagates for long distances in the ocean and since many cetaceans are vocal, passive acoustics is a valuable tool for studying and monitoring their behavior. After a brief introduction to and review of passive acoustic tracking methods, this dissertation develops and applies two new methods. Both methods use widely-spaced (tens of kilometers) bottom-mounted hydrophone arrays, as well as propagation models that account for depth-dependent sound speed profiles. The first passive acoustic tracking method relies on arrival times of direct and surface-reflected paths. It is used to track a sperm whale using 5 at the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) and gives position estimates that are accurate to within 10 meters. With such accuracy, the whale's pitch and yaw are estimated by assuming that its main axis (which points from the tail to the rostrum) is parallel to its velocity. Roll is found by fitting the details of the pulses within each sperm whale click to the so-called bent horn model of sperm whale sound production. Finally, given the position and orientation of the whale, its beam pattern is reconstructed and found to be highly directional with an intense forward directed component. Pair-wise spectrogram (PWS) processing is the second passive acoustic tracking method developed in this dissertation. Although it is computationally more intensive, vi PWS has several advantages over arrival-time tracking methods, especially in shallow water environments, for long duration calls, and for multiple-animal datasets, as is the case for humpback whales on Hawaiian breeding grounds. Results of simulations with realistic noise conditions and environmental mismatch are given and compared to other passive localization techniques. When applied to the AUTEC sperm whale dataset, PWS position estimates are within meters of those obtained using the time-of-arrival method.},

In other words, it solves the problem of associating TDOAs to whales. The algorithm is able to resolve association disputes where a given TDOA measurement may fit to more than one position estimate and can handle spurious TDOAs. The algorithm also provides estimates of Cramer-Rao lower bound for the position estimates. The algorithm was tested with real data using TDOA estimates obtained by cross-correlating click-trains. The click-trains were generated by a separate algorithm that operated independently on each sensor to produce click-trains corresponding to a given whale and to reject click-trains from reflected propagation paths.},

	abstract = {Sonar and radar systems not only detect targets but also localize them. The process of localization involves bearing and range estimation. These objectives of bearing and range estimation can be accomplished actively or passively, depending on the situation. In active sonar or radar systems, a pulsed signal is transmitted to the target and the echo is received at the receiver. The range of the target is determined from the time delay obtained from the echo. In passive sonar systems, the target is detected from acoustic signals emitted by the target, and it is localized using time delays obtained from received signals at spacially separated points. Several authors have calculated the variance of the time delay estimate in the neighborhood of true time delays and have presented their results in terms of coherence function and signal and noise autospectra. Here we analyze these derivations and show that they are the same for the case of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We also address a practical problem with a target-generated wide-band signal and present the Cramér-Rao lower bound on the variance of the time delay estimate as a function of commonly understood terms such as SNR, bandwidth, observation time, and center frequency of the band. The analysis shows that in the case of low SNR and when signal and noise autospectra are constants over the band or signal and noise autospectra fall off at the same rate, the minimum standard deviation of the time delay estimate varies inversely to the SNR, to the square root of the product of observation time and bandwidth, and to the center frequency (provided , where = bandwidth and = center frequency of the band). The only difference in the case of a high SNR is that the standard deviation varies inversely to the square root of the SNR, and all other parameter relationships are the same. We also address the effects of different signal and noise autospectral slopes on the variance of the time delay estimate in passive localization.},

Most previous studies on the impacts of the biomedical bleeding process on horseshoe crabs have focused on mortality rates and sublethal impacts in the laboratory. In this study, we investigated the effects of the bleeding process on the behavior of horseshoe crabs after they had been released back into their natural environment. A total of 28 horseshoe crabs (14 control and 14 bled) were fitted with acoustic transmitters and released into the Great Bay Estuary, New Hampshire, during the spring of 2016. The acoustic tags transmitted information about the activity and depth of each animal, and these data were logged by an array of passive acoustic receivers. These data were collected from May to December 2016 and from March to Octo-ber 2017. Bled animals approached mating beaches less than control animals during the first week after release, with the greatest differences between bled and control females. Bled animals also remained significantly deeper during the spawning season than control animals. However, overall, bled and control animals expressed similar biological rhythms and seasonal migrations. Thus, it appears as if the most obvious impacts of the bleeding process take place during the first one to two weeks after crabs are bled.},

Unlike the multivariate normal copula, the proposed copula is based on the assumption that a common factor exists and affects the joint dependence of all measurements of the process. Moreover, the proposed copula can model tail dependence and tail asymmetry. The model is parameterized in terms of a covariance function that may be chosen from the many models proposed in the literature, such as the Matérn model. For some choice of common factors, the joint copula density is given in closed form and therefore likelihood estimation is very fast. In the general case, one-dimensional numerical integration is needed to calculate the likelihood, but estimation is still reasonably fast even with large data sets. We use simulation studies to show the wide range of dependence structures that can be generated by the proposed model with different choices of common factors. We apply the proposed model to spatial temperature data and compare its performance with some popular geostatistics models.},

	abstract = {The authors present the analysis of the acoustic propagation measurements conducted in November (7th-17th) 2016 near the shores of North East Corsica using the ALMA (Acoustic Laboratory for Marine Applications) system. The campaign is fully described in a companion paper (see Fattaccioli \& Real, session "Design of new experimental facilities to address future problems in underwater acoustics"). The array consisted of 128 hydrophones arranged in a comblike configuration (4x32 vertical linear arrays). A moored pinger, 9 km from the arrays, transmitted signals with a 1 minute repetition rate. The study of the influence of fluctuations in the water column (typically internal waves, very frequent in shallow waters and coastal environments) on sound waves propagation is aimed. To do so, fluctuations of the received wavefronts at various frequencies (from 1kHz to 13kHz) on each of the four joint vertical linear arrays are shown. Statistics of the recorded data are also provided, including Mutual Coherence Function (MCF), radius of coherence and array gain degradation. The non-stationarity and non-uniformity of the received data highlights the influence of spatio-temporal variations of the medium. In complement, CTD casts were performed at various times at the source and receiver locations. A CTD chain was deployed next to the receiving array so that environmental fluctuations are monitored during the campaign whole duration. The presence of a strong thermocline is shown by the data analysis.},

The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors-agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor-increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

	abstract = {Deep-sea ecosystems have attracted considerable commercial interest in recent years because of their potential to sustain a diverse range of mankind's industrial needs. If these systems are to be preserved or exploited in a sustainable manner, mapping habitats and species distributions is critical. As biodiversity at cold-seeps or other deep-sea ecosystems is driven by habitat heterogeneity, imagery is the obvious choice for characterizing these systems and has indeed proven extremely valuable towards mapping biogenic habitats formed by dense aggregations of large sized species, such as coral reefs, tubeworm bushes or bivalve beds. However, the acquisition of detailed images with resolution sufficient for reliable identification is extremely time consuming, labor intensive and highly susceptible to logistical issues. We developed a novel method for quickly mapping cold seep fauna and habitats over large areas, at the scale of squares of kilometers. Our method uses multibeam echosounder bathymetry and acoustic backscatter data, both segmented and reclassified based on topographical features and then combined to obtain a raster containing unique values incorporating both backscatter and bathymetry data. Two datasets, obtained from 30m and 8m above the seafloor were used and the results from the two datasets were compared. The method was applied to a cold seep community located in a pockmark in the deep Congo channel and we were able to ground truth the accuracy of our method against images of the area. The two datasets, obtained from different altitudes gave varying results: the 8m altitude dataset reliably predicted tubeworms and carbonate rock, while the 30m altitude dataset predicted tubeworms and vesicomyid clams. The 30m dataset was more accurate than the 8m altitude dataset in predicting distributions of tubeworms. Overall, all the predictions were quite accurate, with at least 90\% of predictions being within 5m of real distributions.},

These wilderness areas contain high genetic diversity, unique functional traits, and endemic species [4–7]; maintain high levels of ecological and evolutionary connectivity [8–10]; and may be well placed to resist and recover from the impacts of climate change [11–13]. On land, rapid declines in wilderness [3] have led to urgent calls for its protection [3, 14]. In contrast, little is known about the extent and protection of marine wilderness [4, 5]. Here we systematically map marine wilderness globally by identifying areas that have both very little impact (lowest 10\%) from 15 anthropogenic stressors and also a very low combined cumulative impact from these stressors. We discover that ∼13\% of the ocean meets this definition of global wilderness, with most being located in the high seas. Recognizing that human influence differs across ocean regions, we repeat the analysis within each of the 16 ocean realms [15].

We also show that the marine protected area estate holds only 4.9\% of global wilderness and 4.1\% of realm-specific wilderness, very little of which is in biodiverse ecosystems such as coral reefs. Proactive retention of marine wilderness should now be incorporated into global strategies aimed at conserving biodiversity and ensuring that large-scale ecological and evolutionary processes continue.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessh3{\textbackslash}textgreaterVideo Abstract{\textbackslash}textless/h3{\textbackslash}textgreater},

Assessment of underwater noise is increasingly required by regulators of development projects in marine and freshwater habitats, and noise pollution can be a constraining factor in the consenting process. Noise levels arising from the proposed activity are modelled and the potential impact on species of interest within the affected area is then evaluated. Although there is considerable uncertainty in the relationship between noise levels and impacts on aquatic species, the science underlying noise modelling is well understood. Nevertheless, many environmental impact assessments (EIAs) do not reflect best practice, and stakeholders and decision makers in the EIA process are often unfamiliar with the concepts and terminology that are integral to interpreting noise exposure predictions. In this paper, we review the process of underwater noise modelling and explore the factors affecting predictions of noise exposure. Finally, we illustrate the consequences of errors and uncertainties in noise modelling, and discuss future research needs to reduce uncertainty in noise assessments.},

Ambient noise recording was carried out by a bottom mounted sensor at 30 m depth at regular interval for a period of over one month and the spectrum in the band 10-1.6 kHz was characterized for its diurnal spectral variation. The study concluded that the distant shipping noise component due to heavy small vessel activity in the nearby port resulted in up to 35 dB variation in the shallow water ambient noise in coastal areas that may have serious implication on passive surveillance algorithms performance in the vicinity if adequately not addressed.

Inverted SSP compared to assimilated SSP indicates close correlation, showing that both methods yield reliable results. Historical data analysis indicates a stable correlation structure under certain conditions, implying the optimal assimilation radius would measure SSP effectively under similar conditions.},

However, mismatched array inclination and uncertain environmental features can produce imprecise trajectories when ray-tracing sequences of individual acoustic events. “Double-difference” methods have previously been developed to determine fine-scale relative locations of earthquakes along a fault [Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000). Bull. Seismolog. Soc. Am. 90, 1353–1368]. This technique translates differences in travel times between nearby seismic events, recorded at multiple widely separated stations, into precise relative displacements. Here, this method for acoustic multipath measurements on a single vertical array of hydrophones is reformulated. Changes over time in both the elevation angles and the relative arrival times of the multipath are converted into relative changes in source position. This approach is tested on data ...},

	abstract = {Mismatch in a beamformer occurs when the knowledge of the signal directional properties is imprecise. The effects of mismatch on a conventional beamformer and two optimum beamformers are compared. One optimum beamformer is based on inversion of the noise cross-spectral matrix while the other is based on inversion of the signal-plus-noise cross-spectral matrix. When there is mismatch, the inclusion of the signal in the matrix inversion process can lead to dramatic reductions in the output signal-to-noise ratio when the output signal-to- noise ratio of a perfectly matched beamformer would be greater than unity. However, the corresponding effect on the total beamformer output is less dramatic since an increase in the noise response partially offsets the decrease in signal response. The question of suppressing mismatched signals is closely related to the question of resolving closely spaced sources. Exact conditions are presented for resolution of closely spaced sources by an optimum beamformer. These results are applied to a line array and compared with the resolution capability of a conventional beamformer. It is found, for example, that an output signal-to-noise ratio of about 47 dB is required to achieve a resolving power with an optimum processor which is ten times that given by the classical Rayleigh limit. Conditions are also presented for the resolution of two sources of unequal strength},

	abstract = {The structure of humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) songs was examined using information theory techniques. The song is an ordered sequence of individual sound elements separated by gaps of silence. Song samples were converted into sequences of discrete symbols by both human and automated classifiers. This paper analyzes the song structure in these symbol sequences using information entropy estimators and autocorrelation estimators. Both parametric and nonparametric entropy estimators are applied to the symbol sequences representing the songs. The results provide quantitative evidence consistent with the hierarchical structure proposed for these songs by Payne and McVay [Science 173, 587-597 (1971)]. Specifically, this analysis demonstrates that: (1) There is a strong structural constraint, or syntax, in the generation of the songs, and (2) the structural constraints exhibit periodicities with periods of 6-8 and 180-400 units. This implies that no empirical Markov model is capable of representing the songs' structure. The results are robust to the choice of either human or automated song-to-symbol classifiers. In addition, the entropy estimates indicate that the maximum amount of information that could be communicated by the sequence of sounds made is less than 1 bit per second.},

The paper gives an overview of the model configurations, experiments related forcings, and initialization procedures and presents results for the simulated changes in climate and carbon cycle. It is found that the climate feedback depends on the global warming and possibly the forcing history. The global warming from climatological 1850 conditions to 2080–2100 ranges from 1.5°C under the RCP2.6 scenario to 4.4°C under the RCP8.5 scenario. Over this range, the patterns of temperature and precipitation change are nearly independent of the global warming. The model shows a tendency to reduce the ocean heat uptake efficiency toward a warmer climate, and hence acceleration in warming in the later years. The precipitation sensitivity can be as high as 2.5\% K−1 if the CO2 concentration is constant, or as small as 1.6\% K−1, if the CO2 concentration is increasing. The oceanic uptake of anthropogenic carbon increases over time in all scenarios, being smallest in the experiment forced by RCP2.6 and largest in that for RCP8.5. The land also serves as a net carbon sink in all scenarios, predominantly in boreal regions. The strong tropical carbon sources found in the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 experiments are almost absent in the RCP4.5 experiment, which can be explained by reforestation in the RCP4.5 scenario.},

Coupling robotic sampling with ocean models provides an effective approach to adaptively sample such features. We present methods that capitalize on information from ocean models and in situ measurements, using Gaussian process modeling and objective functions, allowing sampling efforts to be concentrated to regions with high scientific interest. We demonstrate how to combine and correlate marine data from autonomous underwater vehicles, model forecasts, remote sensing satellite, buoy, and ship-based measurements, as a means to cross-validate and improve ocean model accuracy, in addition to resolving upper water-column interactions. Our work is focused on the west coast of Mid-Norway where significant influx of Atlantic Water produces a rich and complex physical–biological coupling, which is hard to measure and characterize due to the harsh environmental conditions. Results from both simulation and full-scale sea trials are presented.},

But wherever color is used to represent numerical values, its role transitions from a mere aesthetic nicety to carrying the responsibility of conveying data honestly and accurately. Yet, biases introduced by some common colormaps have gone widely unrecognized within the oceanographic community. Here, we describe the pitfalls of some commonly used colormaps, provide guidelines on effective, accurate colormap selection, and present a suite of perceptually uniform cmocean colormaps that have been designed for oceanographic data display.

	abstract = {A new version of the general circulation model CNRM-CM has been developed jointly by CNRM-GAME (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques-Groupe d'études de l'Atmosphère Météorologique) and Cerfacs (Centre Européen de Recherche et de Formation Avancée) in order to contribute to phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The purpose of the study is to describe its main features and to provide a preliminary assessment of its mean climatology. CNRM-CM5. 1 includes the atmospheric model ARPEGE-Climat (v5. 2), the ocean model NEMO (v3. 2), the land surface scheme ISBA and the sea ice model GELATO (v5) coupled through the OASIS (v3) system. The main improvements since CMIP3 are the following. Horizontal resolution has been increased both in the atmosphere (from 2. 8° to 1. 4°) and in the ocean (from 2° to 1°). The dynamical core of the atmospheric component has been revised. A new radiation scheme has been introduced and the treatments of tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols have been improved. Particular care has been devoted to ensure mass/water conservation in the atmospheric component. The land surface scheme ISBA has been externalised from the atmospheric model through the SURFEX platform and includes new developments such as a parameterization of sub-grid hydrology, a new freezing scheme and a new bulk parameterisation for ocean surface fluxes. The ocean model is based on the state-of-the-art version of NEMO, which has greatly progressed since the OPA8. 0 version used in the CMIP3 version of CNRM-CM. Finally, the coupling between the different components through OASIS has also received a particular attention to avoid energy loss and spurious drifts. These developments generally lead to a more realistic representation of the mean recent climate and to a reduction of drifts in a preindustrial integration. The large-scale dynamics is generally improved both in the atmosphere and in the ocean, and the bias in mean surface temperature is clearly reduced. However, some flaws remain such as significant precipitation and radiative biases in many regions, or a pronounced drift in three dimensional salinity. © 2012 The Author(s).},

	doi = {10.1109/SECon.2012.6196918},
	abstract = {Doppler Velocity Logs (DVLs) are devices that have considerable and widespread use in maritime applications. They can be used to provide velocity information, with respect to the sea floor, about the vehicle on which they are mounted. The principle which they use to provide this information is, as their name suggests, the Doppler shifting of acoustic signals. This paper seeks to describe the potential accuracy of a DVL as a function of both design and environmental parameters. It takes a two-stage approach in doing so. The first stage is to find the accuracy of a single acoustic beam based on some particular method (in this case: Non-Linear Least Squares parameter estimation). The second step is to find the resulting accuracy of a multi-beam DVL based on the results acquired in the first step. This paper serves as a precursor to designing and building a “DIY” DVL. It's intent is to provide information about some of the design decisions required to achieve a certain accuracy. The paper's methods are more or less independent of the specific methods used in industry, as that information is largely proprietary. The paper is divided in to three parts. The first part is an introduction to the use, capabilities, and functionality of DVLs. The second part concerns the accuracy and simulation of a single acoustic beam of a DVL. The third part discusses the accuracy of a full multibeam configuration as a function of the second.},

This activity will be driven by increased demand for energy and the marine resources of an Arctic Ocean accessible to ships. Oil and gas exploration, fisheries, mineral extraction, marine transportation, research and development, tourism, and search and rescue will increase the pressure on the vulnerable Arctic environment. Technologies that allow synoptic in situ observations year-round are needed to monitor and forecast changes in the Arctic atmosphere-ice-ocean system at daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal scales. These data can inform and enable both sustainable development and enforcement of international Arctic agreements and treaties, while protecting this critical environment. In this paper, we discuss multipurpose acoustic networks, including subsea cable components, in the Arctic. These networks provide communication, power, underwater and under-ice navigation, passive monitoring of ambient sound (ice, seismic, biologic, and anthropogenic), and acoustic remote sensing (tomography and thermometry), supporting and complementing data collection from platforms, moorings, and vehicles. We support the development and implementation of regional to basin-wide acoustic networks as an integral component of a multidisciplinary in situ Arctic Ocean observatory.},

The algorithm was tested using data from the 2010–2011 Philippine Sea Experiment in which six sources were deployed in a pentagon \$400 km on a side. 502 positions of hydrophones in a bottom-moored vertical line array at depths of 485–3037 m drifting in a tidal watch circle up to 600 m in diameter were computed. The sources were 129–450 km from the hydrophone receivers. The mean UNA position error from ground truth was 58 m with a standard deviation of 32 m. The UNA Cold Start Algorithm position can be used as the point in the ocean for calculating acoustic model runs from the source positions with a fourdimensional sound speed ﬁeld from a general circulation model to improve the accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICRA.2015.7139231},
	abstract = {This paper describes an acoustic navigation system that provides mesoscale coverage (hundreds of kilometers) under the ice and presents results from the first multi-month deployment in the Arctic. The hardware consists of ice-tethered acoustic navigation beacons transmitting at 900 Hz that broadcast their latitude and longitude plus several bytes of optional control data. The real-time under-ice navigation algorithm, based on a Kalman filter, uses time-of-flight measurements from these sources to simultaneously estimate vehicle position and depth-averaged local currents. The algorithm described herein was implemented on Seagliders, a type of autonomous underwater glider (AUG), but the underlying theory is applicable to other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As part of an extensive field campaign from March to September 2014, eleven acoustic sources and four Seagliders were deployed to monitor the seasonal melt of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and northern Chukchi Seas. Beacon-to-beacon performance was excellent due to a sound duct at 100 m depth where the transmitters were positioned; the travel-time error at 200 km has a standard deviation of 40 m when sound-speed is known, and ranges in excess of 400 km were obtained. Results with the Seagliders, which were not regularly within the duct, showed reliable acoustic ranges up to 100 km and more sparse but repeatable range measurements to over 400 km. Navigation results are reported for the real-time algorithm run in post-processing mode, using data from a 295-hour segment with significant time spent under ice.},

The method involves searching the optimal ESV from a sparse effective sound velocity table (S-ESVT) as-extracted from an effective sound velocity table (ESVT) by genetic algorithm (GA), which minimizes the burden on the hardware of the system and improves efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs faster and more accurately than traditional methods. Field trial results show that the reversed RMSE of localization can be improved from 5.02 m to 2.35 m using the proposed method, where GPS outputs serve as true values to evaluate the localization performance. The results altogether indicate that the proposed method is well applicable to high-precision real-time localization for UAPSs.},

Data from one mooring are decomposed into linear combination of EOFs.

This method is applied to temperature data collected at a two vertical moorings in the 2006 New Jersey Shelf Shallow Water Experiment (SW06).

	abstract = {An anthropogenic cacophony
Sound travels faster and farther in water than in air. Over evolutionary time, many marine organisms have come to rely on sound production, transmission, and reception for key aspects of their lives. These important behaviors are threatened by an increasing cacophony in the marine environment as human-produced sounds have become louder and more prevalent. Duarte et al. review the importance of biologically produced sounds and the ways in which anthropogenically produced sounds are affecting the marine soundscape.
Science, this issue p. eaba4658
Structured Abstract
BACKGROUNDSound is the sensory cue that travels farthest through the ocean and is used by marine animals, ranging from invertebrates to great whales, to interpret and explore the marine environment and to interact within and among species. Ocean soundscapes are rapidly changing because of massive declines in the abundance of sound-producing animals, increases in anthropogenic noise, and altered contributions of geophysical sources, such as sea ice and storms, owing to climate change. As a result, the soundscape of the Anthropocene ocean is fundamentally different from that of preindustrial times, with anthropogenic noise negatively impacting marine life.
ADVANCESWe find evidence that anthropogenic noise negatively affects marine animals. Strong evidence for such impacts is available for marine mammals, and some studies also find impacts for fishes and invertebrates, marine birds, and reptiles. Noise from vessels, active sonar, synthetic sounds (artificial tones and white noise), and acoustic deterrent devices are all found to affect marine animals, as are noise from energy and construction infrastructure and seismic surveys. Although there is clear evidence that noise compromises hearing ability and induces physiological and behavioral changes in marine animals, there is lower confidence that anthropogenic noise increases the mortality of marine animals and the settlement of their larvae.
OUTLOOKAnthropogenic noise is a stressor for marine animals. Thus, we call for it to be included in assessments of cumulative pressures on marine ecosystems. Compared with other stressors that are persistent in the environment, such as carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere or persistent organic pollutants delivered to marine ecosystems, anthropogenic noise is typically a point-source pollutant, the effects of which decline swiftly once sources are removed. The evidence summarized here encourages national and international policies to become more ambitious in regulating and deploying existing technological solutions to mitigate marine noise and improve the human stewardship of ocean soundscapes to maintain a healthy ocean. We provide a range of solutions that may help, supported by appropriate managerial and policy frameworks that may help to mitigate impacts on marine animals derived from anthropogenic noise and perturbations of soundscapes. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/371/6529/eaba4658/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Changing ocean soundscapes.The illustrations from top to bottom show ocean soundscapes from before the industrial revolution that were largely composed of sounds from geological (geophony) and biological sources (biophony), with minor contributions from human sources (anthrophony), to the present Anthropocene oceans, where anthropogenic noise and reduced biophony owing to the depleted abundance of marine animals and healthy habitats have led to impacts on marine animals. These impacts range from behavioral and physiological to, in extreme cases, death. As human activities in the ocean continue to increase, management options need be deployed to prevent these impacts from growing under a “business-as-usual” scenario and instead lead to well-managed soundscapes in a future, healthy ocean. AUV, autonomous underwater vehicle.ILLUSTRATION: XAVIER PITA/KAUST
Oceans have become substantially noisier since the Industrial Revolution. Shipping, resource exploration, and infrastructure development have increased the anthrophony (sounds generated by human activities), whereas the biophony (sounds of biological origin) has been reduced by hunting, fishing, and habitat degradation. Climate change is affecting geophony (abiotic, natural sounds). Existing evidence shows that anthrophony affects marine animals at multiple levels, including their behavior, physiology, and, in extreme cases, survival. This should prompt management actions to deploy existing solutions to reduce noise levels in the ocean, thereby allowing marine animals to reestablish their use of ocean sound as a central ecological trait in a healthy ocean.},

The July–August mean mixed layer depth based on the Ice-Tethered Profiler data averaged 16 m (an overestimate due to the Ice-Tethered Profiler sampling characteristics and present analysis procedures), while the average winter mixed layer depth was only 24 m, with individual observations rarely exceeding 40 m. Guidance interpreting the observations is provided by a 1-D ocean mixed layer model. The analysis focuses attention on the very strong density stratification at the base of the mixed layer in the Canada Basin that greatly impedes surface layer deepening and thus limits the flux of deep ocean heat to the surface that could influence sea ice growth/decay. The observations additionally suggest that efficient lateral mixed layer restratification processes are active in the Arctic, also impeding mixed layer deepening.},

	abstract = {Arctic Ocean measurements reveal a near doubling of ocean heat content relative to the freezing temperature in the Beaufort Gyre halocline over the past three decades (1987–2017). This warming is linked to anomalous solar heating of surface waters in the northern Chukchi Sea, a main entryway for halocline waters to join the interior Beaufort Gyre. Summer solar heat absorption by the surface waters has increased fivefold over the same time period, chiefly because of reduced sea ice coverage. It is shown that the solar heating, considered together with subduction rates of surface water in this region, is sufficient to account for the observed halocline warming. Heat absorption at the basin margins and its subsequent accumulation in the ocean interior, therefore, have consequences for Beaufort Gyre sea ice beyond the summer season.
Reduced sea ice cover opens a conduit for solar-heated water to reach the interior Arctic Basin halocline.

	abstract = {Six Ice-Tethered Profilers (ITP), deployed in the central Canada Basin of the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2007, have provided detailed potential temperature and salinity measurements of a double-diffusive staircase at about 200–300 m depth. Individual layers in the staircase are of order 1 m in vertical height but appear to extend horizontally for hundreds of kilometers, with along-layer gradients of temperature and salinity tightly related. On the basis of laboratory-derived double-diffusive flux laws, estimated vertical heat fluxes through the staircase are in the range 0.05–0.3 W m−2, only about one tenth of the estimated mean surface mixed layer heat flux to the sea ice. It is thus concluded that the vertical transport of heat from the Atlantic Water in the central basin is unlikely to have a significant impact to the Canada Basin ocean surface heat budget. Icebreaker conductivity-temperature-depth data from the Beaufort Gyre Freshwater Experiment show that the staircase is absent at the basin periphery. Turbulent mixing that presumably disrupts the staircase might drive greater flux from the Atlantic Water at the basin boundaries and possibly dominate the regionally averaged heat flux.},

The observed horizontal gradients in density are dynamically important in that they are associated with restratification of the surface ocean when dense water flows under light water. Such restratification is prevalent in wintertime and competes with convective mixing upon buoyancy forcing (e.g., ice growth and brine rejection) and shear-driven mixing when the ice moves relative to the ocean. Frontal structure and estimates of the balanced Richardson number point to the likelihood of dynamical restratification by isopycnal tilt and submesoscale baroclinic instability. Based on the evidence here, it is likely that submesoscale processes play an important role in setting surface-layer properties and lateral density variability in the Arctic Ocean.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/section{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The location of the Antarctic Polar Front (PF) was mapped over a 7-year period (1987–1993) within images of satellite-derived sea surface temperature. The mean path of the PF is strongly steered by the topographic features of the Southern Ocean. The topography places vorticity constraints on the dynamics of the PF that strongly affect spatial and temporal variability. Over the deep ocean basins the surface expression of the PF is weakened, and the PF meanders over a wide latitudinal range. Near large topographic features, width and temperature change across the front increase, and large-scale meandering is inhibited. Elevated mesoscale variability is seen within and downstream of these areas and may be the result of baroclinic instabilities initiated where the PF encounters large topographic features. The strong correlations between topography and PF dynamics can be understood in the context of the planetary potential vorticity (PPV or f/H) field. Mean PPV at the PF varies by more than a factor of 2 along its circumpolar path. However, at the mesoscale the PF remains within a relatively narrow range of PPV values around the local mean. Away from large topographic features, the PF returns to a preferred PPV value of ∼25 × 10−9 m−1 s−1 despite large latitudinal shifts. The mean paths of the surface and subsurface expressions of the PF are closely coupled over much of the Southern Ocean.},

	abstract = {Sea ice freeboard heights in the Weddell Sea of Antarctica are derived from the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) laser altimeter measurements, which have a unique range precision to flat surfaces of 2 cm within 70 m footprints spaced at 172 m along track. Although elevations of flat surfaces can be obtained to an accuracy of ∼10 cm (1σ) per footprint, direct determination of freeboard heights is precluded by errors in knowledge of the geoid and temporal variability of the ocean surface. Therefore freeboards are determined relative to an ocean reference level detected over areas of open water and very thin ice within the sea ice pack using an along-track filtering method. The open water/thin ice selections show good agreement in the combined analysis of ICESat segments and Envisat Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery. The average residual between the ICESat-measured ocean level and the EGM96 geoid is 1.4 m. Estimates of snow depth on the sea ice from AMSR-E passive microwave data along with nominal densities of snow, water, and sea ice are used to estimate sea ice thickness. Four periods of ICESat data in May–June (fall) and October–November (late winter) of 2004 and 2005 between longitudes 298°E and 360°E are analyzed. In the fall the mean freeboards are 0.28 m in 2004 and 0.29 m in 2005, and the mean thicknesses are 1.33 m in 2004 and 1.52 m in 2005. In late winter the freeboards grew to 0.37 m in 2004 and 0.35 in 2005, and the thicknesses grew to 2.23 m in 2004 and 2.31 m in 2005. The interannual differences in freeboard are small, and the larger interannual change in estimated thickness mainly represents differences in the snow depth estimates. Seasonal changes in the spatial patterns of freeboard and thickness over the 4 months correlate with the expected circulation of sea ice in the Weddell Sea, as indicated by sea ice velocity fields.},

	abstract = {Recent research using microwave satellite remote sensing data has established that there has been a reduction of about 3 percent per decade in the areal extent of the Arctic sea ice cover since 1978, although it is unknown whether the nature of the perennial ice pack has changed. These data were used to quantify changes in the ice cover's composition, revealing a substantial reduction of about 14 percent in the area of multiyear ice in winter during the period from 1978 to 1998. There also appears to be a strong correlation between the area of multiyear ice and the spatially averaged thickness of the perennial ice pack, which suggests that the satellite-derived areal decreases represent substantial rather than only peripheral changes. If this apparent transformation continues, it may lead to a markedly different ice regime in the Arctic, altering heat and mass exchanges as well as ocean stratification.},

	abstract = {Global sea ice products are produced from the Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both the Terra and Aqua satellites. Daily sea ice extent and ice surface temperature (IST) products are available at 1- and 4-km resolution. Validation activities during the "cold period" (when meltwater is generally not present) in the Northern Hemisphere, defined here as October through May, have been undertaken to assess the accuracy of the 1-km resolution MODIS IST algorithm and product. Validation was also done at the South Pole station in Antarctica. In the Arctic Ocean, near-surface air temperatures from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Ocean Service (NOS) Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS) Alaska tide stations and from drifting buoys from the North Pole Environmental Observatory (NPEO) buoy program were compared with MODIS-derived ISTs. Using the standard MODIS sea ice product, which utilizes the MODIS cloud mask, results show a bias (mean error) of -2.1 K and a root mean square (RMS) error of 3.7 K. The negative bias means that the satellite retrieval is less than the air temperature. With the bias removed, the RMS error is 3.0 K. When additional visual cloud screening is performed to eliminate MODIS pixels thought to be contaminated by fog, results improved, with a subset of the larger dataset showing a bias of -0.9 K and an RMS error of 1.6 K. Uncertainties would be reduced in the Arctic Ocean dataset if the skin temperature of the sea ice were reported instead of the near-surface air temperatures. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the Arctic Ocean dataset is 1.3 K. Results from the South Pole station in Antarctica show that under clear skies as determined using lidar measurements, the MODIS ISTs are also very close to those of the near-surface air temperatures with a bias of -1.2 K and an RMS error of 1.7 K. With the bias removed, the RMS error for the South Pole dataset is 1.2 K. Thus, the accuracy (RMS error) of the IST measurement is 1.2-1.3 K. It is not possible to obtain an accurate IST from MODIS in the presence of even very thin clouds or fog, and this is the main limitation of the MODIS ice surface temperature product. MODIS sea ice products may be ordered from the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, CO.},

	abstract = {Underwater ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea, collected in March 2016, is analyzed to investigate the effect that environmental changes in the region have on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ice-generated ambient noise. In particular, the influx of warm Pacific water, so called the Beaufort Lens, has dramatically altered the level and vertical directionality of ambient noise, creating a low noise zone in the ∼75–250 m depth interval with a noise notch at low grazing angles. It is also demonstrated how the observed noise vertical directionality is consistent with ice-mechanical activity along an active pressure ridge ∼30–50 km from the recording array, as shown by satellite imagery. The discrete ranges to this ice activity explain the peak arrival angles between −10 to −15 degrees in noise vertical directionality, as well as the horizontal noise notch. Transient noise events associated with the ice activity are analyzed using an image processing approach with hierarchical clustering applied to the recorded spectrograms. The observed events are grouped into three categories—short-time-broadband, long-time-narrowband, and long-time-broadband—each likely generated through a different mechanism by the ice cover. The spectral and temporal distribution of these transients are discussed.},

Ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea recorded in experiments more than 20 years apart (SIMI94 and ICEX16) are compared to determine differences that may be attributed to the region's rapidly changing environment. Spectral comparison shows noise within 20–350 Hz is ∼30 dB louder in 1994 than 2016; however, this is likely due to higher array self noise during SIMI94. Beamforming results show ambient noise vertical directionality is focused near the horizontal during SIMI94 but more spread in elevation during ICEX16, with a robust noise notch at the horizontal. Numerical modeling demonstrates that this difference may be attributed to ambient noise during ICEX16 being dominated by surface noise sources at discrete ranges rather than the historical assumption of a continuous and uniform distribution of sources. Temporal statistics of transient ice events show more acoustic activity during SIMI94 than ICEX16 and appear to support the new proposed surface source distribution for ICEX16.},

	abstract = {It is predicted that Arctic Ocean acidity will increase during the next century as a result of carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere and migration into ocean waters. This change has implications for sound transmission because low-pH seawater absorbs less sound than high-pH water. Altered pH will affect sound in the 0.3−10 kHz range if the criterion is met that absorption is the primary cause of attenuation, rather than the alternatives of loss in the ice or seabed. Recent work has exploited sound that meets the criterion, sound trapped in a Beaufort Sea duct composed of Pacific Winter Water underlying Pacific Summer Water. Arctic pH is expected to drop from 8.1 to 7.9 (approximately) over the next 30−50 yr, and effects of this chemical alteration on the intensity levels of this ducted sound, and on noise, are examined here. Sound near 900 Hz is predicted to undergo the greatest change, traveling up to 38\% further. At ranges of 100−300 km, sound levels from a source in the duct may increase by 7 dB or more. Noise would also increase, but noise is ducted less efficiently, with the result that 1 kHz noise is predicted to rise approximately 0.5 dB.},

This study seeks to quantify the annual cycle of the thermohaline structure in the Beaufort Sea and characterize acoustically relevant oceanographic processes such as eddies, internal waves, near-inertial waves (NIWs), and spice. The observations are from a seven-mooring, 150-km radius acoustic transceiver array equipped with oceanographic sensors that collected data in the Beaufort Sea from 2016 to 2017. Depth and time variations of the sound speed are analyzed using isopycnal displacements, allowing a separation of baroclinic processes and spice. Compared to lower latitudes, the overall sound speed variability is small with a maximum root mean square of 0.6 m/s. The largest source of variability is spice, most significant in the upper 100 m, followed by eddies and internal waves. The displacement spectrum in the internal wave band is time dependent and different from the Garret-Munk (GM) spectrum. The internal wave energy varied with time averaging 5\% of the GM spectrum. The spice sound-speed frequency spectrum has a form very different from the displacement spectrum, a result not seen at lower latitudes. Because sound speed variations are weak, observations of episodic energetic NIWs with horizontal currents up to 20 cm/s have potential acoustical consequences.},

The goal of the TADMUS program was to develop training, simulation, decision support, and display principles that would help to mitigate the impact of stress on decision making. A single case study was developed to study the effect of TADMUS coping techniques throughout a nine-month course of therapy. The individual in question had a middle management position in the computer industry, whose typical day entailed decision-making responsibilities that required accurate, efficient, and effective problem solving strategies. The client was referred to the writer by an insurance company to "receive counseling for depression," and has lived in metropolitan Vancouver for the past three years. He was taught progressive deep muscle relaxation (PDMR) to increase performance readiness by improving his stress threshold. A primary motive for utilizing the TADMUS stress training program with a client diagnosed with affective disorder was to teach a coping stratagem that could be interfaced with each job function. In summary, the TADMUS training program has definite potential in the field of rehabilitation and mental health, primarily teaching hands-on skills to those individuals returning to a work environment after stress leave.

	abstract = {The recent warming in the Arctic is affecting a broad spectrum of physical, ecological, and human/cultural systems that may be irreversible on century time scales and have the potential to cause rapid changes in the earth system. The response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to changes in climate is a major issue of global concern, yet there has not been a comprehensive review of the status of the contemporary carbon cycle of the Arctic and its response to climate change. This review is designed to clarify key uncertainties and vulnerabilities in the response of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to ongoing climatic change. While it is clear that there are substantial stocks of carbon in the Arctic, there are also significant uncertainties associated with the magnitude of organic matter stocks contained in permafrost and the storage of methane hydrates beneath both subterranean and submerged permafrost of the Arctic. In the context of the global carbon cycle, this review demonstrates that the Arctic plays an important role in the global dynamics of both CO2 and CH4. Studies suggest that the Arctic has been a sink for atmospheric CO2 of between 0 and 0.8 Pg C/yr in recent decades, which is between 0\% and 25\% of the global net land/ocean flux during the 1990s. The Arctic is a substantial source of CH4 to the atmosphere (between 32 and 112 Tg CH4/yr), primarily because of the large area of wetlands throughout the region. Analyses to date indicate that the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic during the remainder of the 21st century is highly uncertain. To improve the capability to assess the sensitivity of the carbon cycle of the Arctic to projected climate change, we recommend that (1) integrated regional studies be conducted to link observations of carbon dynamics to the processes that are likely to influence those dynamics, and (2) the understanding gained from these integrated studies be incorporated into both uncoupled and fully coupled carbon–climate modeling efforts.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification (OA), driven by rising anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), is rapidly advancing in the Pacific Arctic Region (PAR), producing conditions newly corrosive to biologically important carbonate minerals like aragonite. Naturally short linkages across the PAR food web mean that species-specific acidification stress can be rapidly transmitted across multiple trophic levels, resulting in widespread impacts. Therefore, it is critical to understand the formation, transport, and persistence of acidified conditions in the PAR in order to better understand and project potential impacts to this delicately balanced ecosystem. Here, we synthesize data from process studies across the PAR to show the formation of corrosive conditions in colder, denser winter-modified Pacific waters over shallow shelves, resulting from the combination of seasonal terrestrial and marine organic matter respiration with anthropogenic CO2. When these waters are subsequently transported off the shelf, they acidify the Pacific halocline. We estimate that Barrow Canyon outflow delivers {\textasciitilde}2.24 Tg C yr-1 to the Arctic Ocean through corrosive winter water transport. This synthesis also allows the combination of spatial data with temporal data to show the persistence of these conditions in halocline waters. For example, one study in this synthesis indicated that 0.5–1.7 Tg C yr-1 may be returned to the atmosphere via air-sea gas exchange of CO2 during upwelling events along the Beaufort Sea shelf that bring Pacific halocline waters to the ocean surface. The loss of CO2 during these events is more than sufficient to eliminate corrosive conditions in the upwelled Pacific halocline waters. However, corresponding moored and discrete data records indicate that potentially corrosive Pacific waters are present in the Beaufort shelfbreak jet during 80\% of the year, indicating that the persistence of acidified waters in the Pacific halocline far outweighs any seasonal mitigation from upwelling. Across the datasets in this large-scale synthesis, we estimate that the persistent corrosivity of the Pacific halocline is a recent phenomenon that appeared between 1975 and 1985. Over that short time, these potentially corrosive waters originating over the continental shelves have been observed as far as the entrances to Amundsen Gulf and M’Clure Strait in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The formation and transport of corrosive waters on the Pacific Arctic shelves may have widespread impact on the Arctic biogeochemical system and food web reaching all the way to the North Atlantic.},

Here we synthesize field data from arctic Alaska, showing that terrestrial changes in summer albedo contribute substantially to recent high-latitude warming trends. Pronounced terrestrial summer warming in arctic Alaska correlates with a lengthening of the snow-free season that has increased atmospheric heating locally by about 3 watts per square meter per decade (similar in magnitude to the regional heating expected over multiple decades from a doubling of atmospheric CO2). The continuation of current trends in shrub and tree expansion could further amplify this atmospheric heating by two to seven times.
The longer snow-free season in Alaska increases energy absorption from the Sun, contributing as much to arctic warming as do rising greenhouse gas levels.

	abstract = {The highly productive fisheries of Alaska are located in seas projected to experience strong global change, including rapid transitions in temperature and ocean acidification-driven changes in pH and other chemical parameters. Many of the marine organisms that are most intensely affected by ocean acidification (OA) contribute substantially to the state’s commercial fisheries and traditional subsistence way of life. Prior studies of OA’s potential impacts on human communities have focused only on possible direct economic losses from specific scenarios of human dependence on commercial harvests and damages to marine species. However, other economic and social impacts, such as changes in food security or livelihoods, are also likely to result from climate change. This study evaluates patterns of dependence on marine resources within Alaska that could be negatively impacted by OA and current community characteristics to assess the potential risk to the fishery sector from OA. Here, we used a risk assessment framework based on one developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to analyze earth-system global ocean model hindcasts and projections of ocean chemistry, fisheries harvest data, and demographic information. The fisheries examined were: shellfish, salmon and other finfish. The final index incorporates all of these data to compare overall risk among Alaska’s federally designated census areas. The analysis showed that regions in southeast and southwest Alaska that are highly reliant on fishery harvests and have relatively lower incomes and employment alternatives likely face the highest risk from OA. Although this study is an intermediate step toward our full understanding, the results presented here show that OA merits consideration in policy planning, as it may represent another challenge to Alaskan communities, some of which are already under acute socio-economic strains.},

	abstract = {Pacific Water (PW) enters the Arctic Ocean through Bering Strait and brings in heat, fresh water, and nutrients from the northern Bering Sea. The circulation of PW in the central Arctic Ocean is only partially understood due to the lack of observations. In this paper, pathways of PW are investigated using simulations with six state-of-the art regional and global Ocean General Circulation Models (OGCMs). In the simulations, PW is tracked by a passive tracer, released in Bering Strait. Simulated PW spreads from the Bering Strait region in three major branches. One of them starts in the Barrow Canyon, bringing PW along the continental slope of Alaska into the Canadian Straits and then into Baffin Bay. The second begins in the vicinity of the Herald Canyon and transports PW along the continental slope of the East Siberian Sea into the Transpolar Drift, and then through Fram Strait and the Greenland Sea. The third branch begins near the Herald Shoal and the central Chukchi shelf and brings PW into the Beaufort Gyre. In the models, the wind, acting via Ekman pumping, drives the seasonal and interannual variability of PW in the Canadian Basin of the Arctic Ocean. The wind affects the simulated PW pathways by changing the vertical shear of the relative vorticity of the ocean flow in the Canada Basin.},

It has been named the Chukchi slope current, which is believed to emanate from Barrow Canyon. The current is surface-intensified, order 50km wide, and advects both summer and winter waters. It is not trapped to a particular isobath, but instead is reminiscent of a free jet. There is no significant variation in Pacific water transport with distance from Barrow Canyon. A potential vorticity analysis suggests that the flow is baroclinically unstable, consistent with the notion that it meanders. The current is present during all synoptic wind conditions, but increases in strength from summer to fall presumably due to the seasonal enhancement of the easterly winds in the region. Its transport increased over the 12-year period of data coverage, also likely in response to wind forcing. In the mean, the slope current transports 0.50±0.07Sv of Pacific water. This estimate allows us to construct a balanced mass budget of the Chukchi shelf inflows and outflows. Our study also confirms the existence of an eastward-flowing Chukchi shelfbreak jet transporting 0.10±0.03Sv of Pacific water towards Barrow Canyon.},

	abstract = {An automated, easily deployed Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instrument system, developed for deployment on perennial sea ice in the polar oceans to measure changes in upper ocean water properties in all seasons, is described, and representative data from prototype instruments are presented. The ITP instrument consists of three components: a surface subsystem that sits atop an ice floe; a weighted, plastic-jacketed wire-rope tether of arbitrary length (up to 800 m) suspended from the surface element; and an instrumented underwater unit that employs a traction drive to profile up and down the wire tether. ITPs profile the water column at a programmed sampling interval; after each profile, the underwater unit transfers two files holding oceanographic and engineering data to the surface unit using an inductive modem and from the surface instrument to a shore-based data server using an Iridium transmitter. The surface instrument also accumulates battery voltage readings, buoy temperature data, and locations from a GPS receiver at a specified interval (usually every hour) and transmits those data daily. Oceanographic and engineering data are processed, displayed, and made available in near–real time (available online at http://www.whoi.edu/ itp). Six ITPs were deployed in the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2006 in the Beaufort gyre with various programmed sampling schedules of two to six one-way traverses per day between 10- and 750–760-m depth, providing more than 5300 profiles in all seasons (as of July 2007). The acquired CTD profile data document interesting spatial variations in the major water masses of the Canada Basin, show the double-diffusive thermohaline staircase that lies above the warm, salty Atlantic layer, measure seasonal surface mixed layer deepening, and document several mesoscale eddies. Augmenting the systems already deployed and to replace expiring systems, an international array of more than one dozen ITPs will be deployed as part of the Arctic Observing Network during the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2007–08) holding promise for more valuable real-time upper ocean observations for operational needs, to support studies of ocean processes, and to facilitate numerical model initialization and validation.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02897},
	abstract = {This paper describes the development and experimental results of navigation algorithms for an autonomous underwater glider (AUG) that uses an on-board acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP). AUGs are buoyancy-driven autonomous underwater vehicles that use small hydrofoils to make forward progress while profiling vertically. During each dive, which can last up to 6 hours, the Seaglider AUG used in this experiment typically reaches the depth of 1000 m and travels 3-6 km horizontally through the water, relying solely on dead-reckoning. Horizontal through-the-water (TTW) progress of AUG is 20-30 cm/s, which is comparable to the speed of the stronger ocean currents. Underwater navigation of an AUG in the presence of unknown advection therefore presents a considerable challenge. We develop two related formulations for post-processing. Both use ADCP observations, through the water velocity estimates, and GPS fixes to estimate current profiles. However, while the first solves an explicit inverse problem for the current profiles only, the second solves a deconvolution problem that infers both states and current profiles using a state-space model. Both approaches agree on their estimates of the ocean current profile through which the AUG was flown using measurements of current relative to the AUG from the ADCP, and estimates of the AUGs TTW velocity from a hydrodynamic model. The result is a complete current profile along the AUGs trajectory, as well as over-the-ground (OTG) velocities for the AUG that can be used for more accurate subsea positioning. Results are demonstrated using 1 MHz ADCP data collected from a Seaglider AUG deployed for 49 days off the north coast of Alaska during August and September 2017. The results are compared to ground truth data from the top 40 meters of the water column, from a moored, upward-facing 600 kHz ADCP.},

	abstract = {Between 2002 and 2011 a single mooring was maintained at the core of the Pacific water boundary current in the Beaufort Sea, approximately 150km east of Pt. Barrow, Alaska. Using velocity and hydrographic data from six year-long deployments, we examine the variability of the current on seasonal to interannual timescales. The seasonal signal is characterized by enhanced values of volume, heat, and freshwater transport during the summer months associated with the presence of two summertime Pacific water masses, Alaskan Coastal Water and Chukchi Summer Water. Strikingly, over the decade the volume transport of the current has decreased by more than 80\%, with comparable reductions in the heat and freshwater transports, despite the fact that the flow through Bering Strait has increased over this time period. The largest changes in the boundary current have occurred in the summer months. Using atmospheric reanalysis fields and weather station data, we demonstrate that an increase in summer easterly winds along the Beaufort slope is the primary cause for the reduction in transport. The stronger winds are due to an intensification of the summer Beaufort High and deepening of the summer Aleutian Low. Using additional mooring and shipboard data in conjunction with satellite fields, we investigate the implications of the reduction in transport of the boundary current. We argue that a significant portion of the mass and heat passing through Bering Strait in recent years has been advected out of Barrow Canyon into the interior Canada Basin – rather than entering the boundary current in the Beaufort Sea – where it is responsible for a significant portion of the increased sea ice melt in the basin.},

Although such a sea ice loss was not indicated until much later in the century in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 4th Assessment Report, many models show an accelerating decline in the summer minimum sea ice extent during the 21st century. Using the observed 2007/2008 September sea ice extents as a starting point, we predict an expected value for a nearly sea ice free Arctic in September by the year 2037. The first quartile of the distribution for the timing of September sea ice loss will be reached by 2028. Our analysis is based on projections from six IPCC models, selected subject to an observational constraints. Uncertainty in the timing of a sea ice free Arctic in September is determined based on both within-model contributions from natural variability and between-model differences.},

The reflectivity of the sea-ice depends on the thickness, the elastic properties, and its roughness. This work focuses on the influence of sea-ice roughness on long-range acoustic propagation, and on how well the arrival structure can be predicted by the full wave integration model OASES. In 2013, acoustic signals centered at 900 Hz were transmitted every hour for three days between ice-tethered buoys in a drifting network in the Fram Strait. The experiment was set up to study the signal stability in the surface channel below the sea-ice. Oceanographic profiles were collected during the experiment, while a statistical description of the rough sea-ice was established based on historical ice-draft measurements. This environmental description is used as input to the range independent version of OASES. The model simulations correspond fairly well with the observations, despite that a flat bathymetry is used and the sea-ice roughness cannot be fully approximated by the statistical representation used in OASES. Long-range transmissions around 900 Hz are found to be more sensitive to the sea-ice roughness than the elastic parameters.},

Thus, only the innovation between the sender’s actual state and the shared state need be sent over the link, such as a very low throughput acoustic modem. The distribution of this innovation can be modeled a priori or assembled adaptively. This distribution is then paired with an arithmetic entropy encoder, producing a very low cost representation of the vehicle’s position vector. This system was analyzed on experimental data from the GLINT10 and AGAVE07 expeditions involving two different classes of AUVs performing a diverse number of maneuvers, and implemented on a ﬁelded vehicle in the MBAT12 experiment. Using an adaptive probability distribution in combination with either of two state observer models, greater than 90\% compression, relative to a 32-b integer baseline, was achieved.},

Unlike the multivariate normal copula, the proposed copula is based on the assumption that a common factor exists and affects the joint dependence of all measurements of the process. Moreover, the proposed copula can model tail dependence and tail asymmetry. The model is parameterized in terms of a covariance function that may be chosen from the many models proposed in the literature, such as the Matérn model. For some choice of common factors, the joint copula density is given in closed form and therefore likelihood estimation is very fast. In the general case, one-dimensional numerical integration is needed to calculate the likelihood, but estimation is still reasonably fast even with large datasets. We use simulation studies to show the wide range of dependence structures that can be generated by the proposed model with different choices of common factors. We apply the proposed model to spatial temperature data and compare its performance with some popular geostatistics models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {A one-year ﬁxed-path observation of seasonally varying subsurface ducted sound propagation in the Beaufort Sea is presented. The ducted and surface-interacting sounds have different time behaviors. To understand this, a surfaceforced computational model of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas with ice cover is used to simulate local conditions, which are then used to computationally simulate sound propagation. A sea ice module is employed to grow/melt ice and to transfer heat and momentum through the ice. The model produces a time- and space-variable duct as observed, with Paciﬁc Winter Water (PWW) beneath a layer of Paciﬁc Summer Water (PSW) and above warm Atlantic water. In the model, PSW moves northward from the Alaskan coastal area in late summer to strengthen the sound duct, and then mean PSW temperature decreases during winter and spring, reducing the duct effectiveness, one cause of a duct annual cycle. Spatially, the modeled PSW is strained and ﬁlamentary, with horizontally structured temperature. Sound simulations (order 200 Hz) suggest that ducting is interrupted by the intermittency of the PSW (duct gaps), with gaps enabling loss from ice cover (set constant in the sound model). The gaps and ducted sound show seasonal tendencies but also exhibit random process behavior. VC 2021 Acoustical Society of America.},

Rapid environmental assessment (REA) missions, e.g., using gliders, and advanced ocean models may be used to reduce this uncertainty before sonar operation in hostile waters. This work shows how data from ocean models may be used for planning of REA missions. The area of operation is divided into oceanographically stable subareas using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and different methods of clustering analyses on SSPs from the ocean model. The acoustic stability of each subarea is assessed using sonar performance modeling. Acoustically unstable areas are divided into smaller subareas. Acoustically stable groups are represented by a single SSP. A map of acoustically stable areas in the area of operation is the main output. Large, geographically contiguous groups indicate acoustically stable areas where frequent SSP measurements are unnecessary, e.g., low concentration of gliders. Small and noncontiguous groups indicate the opposite. Other applications include determination of suitable locations for sonar tests that require stable sonar conditions, and efficient optimization of sonar operation in acoustically stable areas.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to synthesize realistic environment for ocean-acoustic parametric studies. In its current form, this methodology applies to internal waves and tides. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition is applied to a temporal series of temperature profiles. It can be observed that the first two time-dependent expansion coefficients are dynamically linked. When they are plotted one versus another in a scatter diagram, the cloud of points consists of a crescent shape that can easily be represented by a polynomial fit. If the first two expansion coefficients capture enough variability in the temperature profiles, the EOF modes plus the polynomial can be used to reconstruct temperature profiles independently from the set of data. This realistic synthesized environment can then be input to acoustic propagation models. This approach is applied to the case of the Messina Strait in which internal waves are known to be intensive. From a short-term series of temperature profiles collected on a thermistor string, range-dependent profiles along and across the strait are reconstructed. The acoustical impact study is conducted with the range-dependent acoustic model (RAM) parabolic equation (PE) model. The methodology presented in this paper is simple to run and requires a very affordable set of data. It could be used as an efficient alternative to ocean and acoustic model coupling for process studies or for regional studies especially in poorly known areas or highly variable areas, where it is difficult to obtain good sound-speed profile prediction from ocean models.},

Inflow of warm and outflow of melt-enriched waters are identified in two seafloor troughs to the north. Spatial property gradients highlight a previously unknown convergence zone in one trough, where different water masses meet and mix.

The Labrador Sea is the most affected region in the subpolar North Atlantic, with a freshening of 0.2 psu on the western shelves and 0.4 psu in the Labrador Current.

Unlike previous research expeditions to the Arctic the focus was on high resolution imaging and sampling of the deep seafloor. To accomplish our goals we designed two new Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) named Jaguar and Puma, which performed a total of nine dives at depths of up to 4062m. These AUVs were used in combination with a towed vehicle and a conventional CTD (conductivity, temperature and depth) program to characterize the seafloor.

The background noise, although often characterized as Gaussian, is not white, but has a decaying power spectral density. The channel capacity depends on the distance, and may be extremely limited. Because acoustic propagation is best supported at low frequencies, although the total available bandwidth may be low, an acoustic communication system is inherently wideband in the sense that the bandwidth is not negligible with respect to its center frequency. The channel can have a sparse impulse response, where each physical path acts as a time-varying low-pass filter, and motion introduces additional Doppler spreading and shifting. Surface waves, internal turbulence, fluctuations in the sound speed, and other small-scale phenomena contribute to random signal variations. At this time, there are no standardized models for the acoustic channel fading, and experimental measurements are often made to assess the statistical properties of the channel in particular deployment sites.},

The system consists of multiple buoys placed on the ice with transducers suspended 100 m below, each of which is programmed to transmit in a specific time slot at regular intervals. The system operates at 900 Hz, and has programmable bandwidth, from 25 to 100 Hz. The communications data rate for the system is several bits per second, sufficient to transmit the GPS location of the buoys and several bytes of data to vehicles under the ice. The system was deployed in March of 2014 and operated through the fall of 2014, testing the performance of both the navigation and communications capabilities of the system in conjunction with Seagliders deployed by the University of Washington. Ranges of greater than 400 km were achieved with range accuracy of 40 m RMS for the case where the speed of sound is known. The long range and excellent accuracy were the result of ducted sound propagation in the Beaufort Sea.},

	abstract = {Empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) are typically derived from direct measurements of the sound speed proﬁle (SSP) and they are orthogonal in regard to the statistics of the SSP uncertainty. Viewed from the output end of a particular sonar system, however, the effect of an error in one EOF is usually coupled with the effect of the error in another due to the strongly nonlinear relation between the SSP parameters and the system response. In this paper, a new set of basis functions, orthogonal in regard to sonar performance measure, is developed to characterize SSP perturbations. The performance measure used is the Cramer–Rao bound (CRB) for SSP expansion coefﬁcients derived from a full-ﬁeld random Gaussian signal model; a closed-form, analytical solution is obtained for both the range-independent and adiabatically range-dependent environments. The derived functions make the CRB matrix diagonal, decoupling the errors in the estimation of the expansion coefﬁcients. Compared to the EOFs, the new set of basis functions depends on both the statistics of the sound speed uncertainty and the sound waveguide propagation property; it incorporates the measurement noise as well. The development makes possible the investigation of the relative signiﬁcance of the individual basis functions in system response; it also provides a novel framework for optimum acoustic parameterization in adaptive rapid environmental assessment.},

	abstract = {Argo-type profiling floats do not receive satellite positioning while under sea ice. Common practice is to approximate unknown positions by linearly interpolating latitude-longitude between known positions before and after ice cover, although it has been suggested that some improvement may be obtained by interpolating along contours of planetary-geostrophic potential vorticity. Profiles with linearly interpolated positions represent 16\% of the Southern Ocean Argo data set; consequences arising from this approximation have not been quantified. Using three distinct data sets from the Weddell Gyre—10-day satellite-tracked Argo floats, daily-tracked RAFOS-enabled floats, and a particle release simulation in the Southern Ocean State Estimate—we perform a data withholding experiment to assess position uncertainty in latitude-longitude and potential vorticity coordinates as a function of time since last fix. A spatial correlation analysis using the float data provides temperature and salinity uncertainty estimates as a function of distance error. Combining the spatial correlation scales and the position uncertainty, we estimate uncertainty in temperature and salinity as a function of duration of position loss. Maximum position uncertainty for interpolation during 8 months without position data is 116 ± 148 km for latitude-longitude and 92 ± 121 km for potential vorticity coordinates. The estimated maximum uncertainty in local temperature and salinity over the entire 2,000-m profiles during 8 months without position data is 0.66 ∘C and 0.15 psu in the upper 300 m and 0.16 ∘C and 0.01 psu below 300 m.},

The pertinent properties of the SOFAR Channel, such as the vertical trapping and the low rate of attenuation of acoustic energy, are discussed briefly. In particular it is shown that useful acoustic ranges in excess of 1000 km are possible for tracking Swallow floats. Two floats have been built and the details of these, which were designed for 9–12 months operation, are given. The signals from the float, which must be received at at least two hydrophones, are detected in 1 Hz wide bandpass filters and the output is recorded continuously in digital form. The time of arrival of the signals is determined from a visual display of the data. The first two experiments have clearly shown that transmission over these distances is feasible. The abrupt failure of both floats after only a few days is unexplained. Concern is raised about the possibility of biological attack on the floats.},

	abstract = {Four acoustic Seagliders were deployed in the Philippine Sea November 2010 to April 2011 in the vicinity of an acoustic tomography array. The gliders recorded over 2000 broadband transmissions at ranges up to 700 km from moored acoustic sources as they transited between mooring sites. The precision of glider positioning at the time of acoustic reception is important to resolve the fundamental ambiguity between position and sound speed. The Seagliders utilized GPS at the surface and a kinematic model below for positioning. The gliders were typically underwater for about 6.4 h, diving to depths of 1000 m and traveling on average 3.6 km during a dive. Measured acoustic arrival peaks were unambiguously associated with predicted ray arrivals. Statistics of travel-time offsets between received arrivals and acoustic predictions were used to estimate range uncertainty. Range (travel time) uncertainty between the source and the glider position from the kinematic model is estimated to be 639 m (426 ms) rms. Least-squares solutions for glider position estimated from acoustically derived ranges from 5 sources differed by 914 m rms from modeled positions, with estimated uncertainty of 106 m rms in horizontal position. Error analysis included 70 ms rms of uncertainty due to oceanic sound-speed variability.},

	abstract = {Broadband acoustic source transmissions recorded on Seagliders at ranges up to 700 km are used to estimate subsurface glider position. Because the sources transmitted at 9-min intervals the glider moved appreciably between source receptions. Source-glider ranges estimated from acoustic arrivals were combined using least squares analysis to estimate glider position and velocity during each reception period. The analysis was applied to 387 sets of source transmissions using three different flight models of glider subsurface motion for initial position input values. The offsets between the position estimated from the flight models and the acoustically derived position resulting from the inversions were 600-900-m root mean square (rms) depending upon the model and input parameters. The offsets were tripled if the positions from the flight models were not corrected for a dive-averaged current (DAC). Estimates of a posteriori errors ranged from 78-105-m rms and from 9.1-11.6-cm/s rms for glider position and velocity, respectively. Data residuals were on the order of 50-m rms, a dramatic reduction from 178-m rms, which was documented for the case neglecting the motion of the glider between subsequent source transmissions (Van Uffelen , J. Acoust. Soc. Amer., vol. 134, pp. 3260-3271, 2013). Overall horizontal glider speed was estimated to be approximately 21-cm/s rms.},

	abstract = {Detecting acoustic transients by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) becomes problematic in           nonstationary ambient noise environments characteristic of coral reefs. An alternate           approach presented here uses signal directionality to automatically detect and localize           transient impulsive sounds collected on underwater vector sensors spaced tens of meters           apart. The procedure, which does not require precise time synchronization, first           constructs time-frequency representations of both the squared acoustic pressure           (spectrogram) and dominant directionality of the active intensity (azigram) on each           sensor. Within each azigram, sets of time-frequency cells associated with transient energy           arriving from a consistent azimuthal sector are identified. Binary image processing           techniques then link sets that share similar duration and bandwidth between different           sensors, after which the algorithm triangulates the source location. Unlike most passive           acoustic detectors, the threshold criterion for this algorithm is bandwidth instead of           pressure magnitude. Data collected from shallow coral reef environments demonstrate the           algorithm's ability to detect SCUBA bubble plumes and consistent spatial distributions of           somniferous fish activity. Analytical estimates and direct evaluations both yield false           transient localization rates from 3\% to 6\% in a coral reef environment. The SNR           distribution of localized pulses off Hawaii has a median of 7.7 dB and interquartile range           of 7.1 dB.},

	abstract = {Identifying where fish inhabit is a fundamentally important topic in ecology and management allowing acoustically sensitive times and areas to be prioritized. Passive acoustic localization has the benefit of being a non-invasive and non-destructive observational tool, and provides unbiased data on the position and movement of aquatic animals. This study used the time difference of arrivals (TDOA) of sound recordings on a four-hydrophone array to pinpoint the location of male oyster toadfish, Opsanus tau, a cryptic fish that produces boatwhistles to attract females. Coupling the TDOA method with cross correlation of the different boatwhistles, individual toadfish were mapped during dawn (0523–0823), midday (1123–1423), dusk (1723–2023) and night (2323−0223) to examine the relationship between temporal and spatial trends. Seven individual males were identified within 0.5–24.2 m of the hydrophone array and 0.0–18.2 m of the other individuals. Uncertainty in passive acoustics localization was investigated using computer simulations as {\textless}2.0 m within a bearing of 033 to 148° of the linear hydrophone array. Passive acoustic monitoring is presented as a viable tool for monitoring the positions of soniferous species, like the oyster toadfish. The method used in this study could be applied to a variety of soniferous fishes, without disturbing them or their environment. Understanding the location of fishes can be linked to temporal and environmental parameters to investigate ecological trends, as well as to vessel activity to discuss how individuals' respond to anthropogenic noise.},

	abstract = {Unprecedented quantities of heat are entering the Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean through Bering Strait, particularly during summer months. Though some heat is lost to the atmosphere during autumn cooling, a significant fraction of the incoming warm, salty water subducts (dives beneath) below a cooler fresher layer of near-surface water, subsequently extending hundreds of kilometers into the Beaufort Gyre. Upward turbulent mixing of these sub-surface pockets of heat is likely accelerating sea ice melt in the region. This Pacific-origin water brings both heat and unique biogeochemical properties, contributing to a changing Arctic ecosystem. However, our ability to understand or forecast the role of this incoming water mass has been hampered by lack of understanding of the physical processes controlling subduction and evolution of this this warm water. Crucially, the processes seen here occur at small horizontal scales not resolved by regional forecast models or climate simulations; new parameterizations must be developed that accurately represent the physics. Here we present novel high resolution observations showing the detailed process of subduction and initial evolution of warm Pacific-origin water in the southern Beaufort Gyre.},

The data are from three days of the PhilSea10 experiment with a single fixed transmitter depth (∼998 m) and 150 receiver depths (∼210–5388 m) of known location, and a great-circle transmitter-receiver distance of ∼510 km. The proposed ranging methods compare observed acoustic records with synthetic records computed through the HYCOM (hybrid coordinate ocean model) model. More than 8900 transmissions over 3 days characterize the statistical variation of range errors. Reliable ranging methods de-emphasize the parts of the data records least likely to be reproduced by the synthetics, which include arrival amplitudes, the later parts of the acoustic records composed of nearly horizontally launched rays (i.e., the finale), and waves that sample a narrow span of ocean depths. The ranging methods proposed normalize amplitudes, measure travel times, or reject parts of the waveforms beyond a critical time. All deliver reliable range estimates based on the time and path-averaged HYCOM model, although the final method performs best. The principles behind these methods are transportable and expected to provide reliable range estimates in different deep water settings.},

The problem is examined here in the range independent case, with axial transmitters and receivers. After showing that moving the receiver by a few kilometers does not compromise the ray identification, an inversion is performed for both a fixed and a moving receiver. Allowing receiver displacements does not reduce the resolution significantly in the upper part of the ocean but does increase the sensitivity to noise. This sensitivity implies that for such experiments the measurement of the travel times must be very accurate. More efficient use of a priori knowledge of the ocean reduces this sensitivity by decreasing the number of degrees of freedom.},

	abstract = {Mesoscale mapping of the ocean sound speed field in a 1000×1000 km area by means of ocean acoustic tomography is greatly enhanced by augmenting a few acoustic moorings with a movable ship-based receiver. Computer simulations based on realistic noise levels in the measured acoustic travel times give 5\% (1\%) residual variance in ΔC(x;y,z) for four (six) acoustic source moorings in an ocean perturbed in the gravest baroclinic mode. For comparison, objective mapping based on traditional vertical profiles requires 3 times the steaming distance to yield equivalent residual error. Detailed results depend on many parameters: the assumed mesoscale spectrum and vertical mode structure, the number of observed multipaths, the mooring configuration, the number of ship stations and the travel time signal level (due to mesoscale eddies) and noise level (due to internal waves and position-keeping errors). These parameters have critical values, below which there is distinct deterioration and beyond which there is little gain. We believe that the critical values can be attained in practice so the ultimate limit on mesoscale mapping is imposed by the internal wave-induced travel time error. This assumes that position keeping of the submerged acoustic sources and receiver by a combination of satellite navigation and high-frequency acoustics can be achieved with ±10-m accuracy. The present study assumes a stationary ocean; a second paper will deal with reciprocal transmissions yielding currents and hence the barotropic mode. This is required in a dynamic ocean model for estimating ΔC(x,y,z;t). All this is preparatory to a tomography experiment in the Greenland Sea in 1988–1989.},

Ocean bottom seismology provides a particularly challenging requirement for timing: millisecond level or better accuracy over a one year interval or longer. While results from an early batch of CSACs have been largely positive, later units have not performed as well. The CSAC specifications have changed, reflecting a decrease in reliability and accuracy of more recent units. We will discuss the impacts of the degraded aging for long-term autonomous experiments. For the majority of applications this change is not very important. However since aging-related phase error increases with the square of time, applications requiring long-term accurate phase such as ocean bottom seismology may be significantly impacted.

	abstract = {The recent Arctic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to the Arctic Ocean's Gakkel Ridge (July/August 2007) aboard the Swedish icebreaker I/B Oden employed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for water-column and ocean bottom surveys. These surveys were unique among AUV operations to date in requiring georeferenced navigation in proximity to the seafloor beneath permanent and moving ice cover. We report results for long-baseline (LBL) acoustic navigation during autonomous under-ice surveys near the seafloor and adaptation of the LBL concept for several typical operational situations including navigation in proximity to the ship during vehicle recoveries. Fixed seafloor transponders were free-fall deployed from the ship for deep positioning. The ship's helicopter collected acoustic travel times from several locations to georeference the transponders' locations, subject to the availability of openings in the ice. Two shallow beacons suspended from the ship provided near-surface spherical navigation in ship-relative coordinates. During routine recoveries, we used this system to navigate the vehicles into open water near the ship before commanding them to surface. In cases in which a vehicle was impaired, its position was still determined acoustically through some combination of its acoustic modem, the fixed seafloor transponders, the ship-deployed transponders, and an onboard backup relay transponder. The techniques employed included ranging adapted for a moving origin and hyperbolic navigation. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Successful command and control (C2) of autonomous vehicles poses challenges that are unique to the marine environment, primarily highly restrictive acoustic communications throughput. To address this, the Unified C2 architecture presented here uses a highly compressed short message encoding scheme (Dynamic Compact Control Language or DCCL) to transfer commands and receive vehicle status. DCCL is readily reconfigurable to provide the flexibility needed to change commands on short notice. Furthermore, operation of multiple types of vehicles requires a C2 architecture that is both scalable and flexible to differences among platform hardware and abilities. The Unified C2 architecture uses the MOOS-IvP autonomy system to act as a “backseat driver” of the vehicle. This provides a uniform interface to the control system on all the vehicles. Also, a hierarchical configuration system is used to allow single changes in configuration to propagate to all vehicles in operation. Status data from all vehicles are displayed visually using Google Earth, which also allows a rapid meshing of data from other sources (sensors, automatic identification system, radar, satellites) from within, as well as outside of, the MOOS-IvP architecture. Results are presented throughout from the CCLNET08, SQUINT08, GLINT08, GLINT09, SWAMSI09, and DURIP09 experiments involving robotic marine autonomous surface craft (ASCs) and Bluefin, OceanServer, and NATO Undersea Research Centre (NURC) autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The acoustic data packets are broadcast from a single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range.

This multiple vehicle navigation technique consists of using vehicles fitted with accurate navigation systems as moving reference transponders to which other vehicles, fitted with less capable navigation systems, can acoustically range to update their position. Reliable acoustic communications are mandatory for the real time implementation of this navigation scheme. However, while enabling MLBL, acoustic communications reduce the range update rate and introduce delays that need to be dealt with in the navigation algorithm. Simulation results show that relative navigation accuracy between vehicles can be maintained although the absolute navigation accuracy of each vehicle decreases over time. This is a key enabling factor for AOFNC missions where contacts are called by vehicles and re-acquired by other vehicles in real-time.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the progress of single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) range measurements for constraining XY position for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Traditional navigation algorithms have used OWTT measurements to constrain an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). These methodologies limit AUV applications to where DVL bottom-lock is available as well as the necessity for expensive strap-down sensors, such as the DVL. Thus, deep water, mid-water column research has mostly been left untouched, and vehicles that need expensive strap-down sensors restrict the possibility of using multiple AUVs to explore a certain area. This work presents a solution for accurate navigation and localization using a vehicle's odometry determined by its dynamic model velocity and constrained by OWTT range measurements from a topside source beacon as well as other AUVs operating in proximity. We present a comparison of two navigation algorithms: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle Filter(PF). Both of these algorithms also incorporate a water velocity bias estimator that further enhances the navigation accuracy and localization. Closed-loop online field results on local waters as well as a real-time implementation of two days field trials operating in Monterey Bay, California during the Keck Institute for Space Studies oceanographic research project prove the accuracy of this methodology with a root mean square error on the order of tens of meters compared to GPS position over a distance traveled of multiple kilometers.},

Autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) have long been seen as a game changer in the exploration and exploitation of the marine environment. Repeated access to remote and hazardous places for data gathering and intervention, enabled by their autonomy, is the key to their adoption. While historically the focus has been on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have recently been developed and adopted at an increasing rate. Interestingly, whereas AMVs (AUVs and USVs) have now been adopted in niche areas (bathymetric surveys and mine countermeasures), they have not yet hit the mainstream. In this article, we review the state of the art in unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), which include ROVs and AUVs; current obstacles to their adoption, both technical and commercial; and recent advances in technology.

	abstract = {Buoyancy driven Slocum Gliders were a vision of Douglas Webb, which Henry Stommel championed in a futuristic vision published in 1989. Slocum Gliders have transitioned from a concept to a technology serving basic research and environmental stewardship. The long duration and low operating costs of Gliders allow them to anchor spatial time series. Large distances, over 600 km, can be covered using a single set of alkaline batteries. Since the initial tests, a wide range of physical and optical sensors have been integrated into the Glider allowing measurements of temperature, salinity, depth averaged currents, surface currents, fluorescence, apparent and inherent optical properties. A command/control center, entitled Dockserver, has been developed that allows users to fly fleets of gliders simultaneously in multiple places around the world via the Internet. Over the last 2.5 years, Rutgers Gliders have logged 27 056 kilometers, and flown 1357 days at sea. Gliders call into the automated Glider Command Center at the Rutgers campus via satellite phone to provide a status update, download data, and receive new mission commands. The ability to operate Gliders for extended periods of time are making them the central in situ technology for the evolving ocean observatories. Off shore New Jersey Gliders have occupied a cross shelf transect and have documented the annual variability in shelf wide stratification on the Mid-Atlantic Bight and the role of storms in sediment resuspension. The sustained data permits scientists to gather regional data critical to addressing if, and how, the oceans are changing. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The primary goal of LCM is to simplify the development of low-latency message passing systems, especially for real-time robotics research applications. Messages can be transmitted between different processes using LCM's publish/subscribe message-passing system. A platformand language-independent type specification language separates message description from implementation. Message specifications are automatically compiled into language-specific bindings, eliminating the need for users to implement marshalling code while guaranteeing run-time type safety. LCM is notable in providing a real-time deep traffic inspection tool that can decode and display message traffic with minimal user effort and no impact on overall system performance. This and other features emphasize LCM's focus on simplifying both the development and debugging of message passing systems. In this paper, we explain the design of LCM, evaluate its performance, and describe its application to a number of autonomous land, underwater, and aerial robots.},

These problems include: primary productivity, ecosystem dynamics, biogeochemical cycling, upper ocean heating, and the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances on ocean dynamics. Technological advances in optical sensors and ocean observing platforms are being used to increase the variety and quantity of optical observations and to greatly expand their sampling capabilities in time and space. Remote sensing of ocean color from aircraft- and satellite-borne instruments is vital to obtain regional- and global-scale optical data synoptically. In situ observations provide complementary subsurface data sets with high temporal and spatial resolution. In situ observations are also essential for calibration and validation of remotely sensed data as well as for algorithm development and data assimilation models. Important challenges remain to synthesize regional and global optical data sets obtained from optical sensors and oceanographic platforms and to utilize these data sets in predictive models of oceanic optical, physical, and biogeochemical dynamics.},

	doi = {10.1109/JOE.2008.2002105},
	abstract = {The goal of adaptive sampling in the ocean is to pre-dict the types and locations of additional ocean measurements that would be most useful to collect. Quantitatively, what is most useful is defined by an objective function and the goal is then to optimize this objective under the constraints of the available observing net-work. Examples of objectives are better oceanic understanding, to improve forecast quality, or to sample regions of high interest. This work provides a new path-planning scheme for the adaptive sam-pling problem. We define the path-planning problem in terms of an optimization framework and propose a method based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). The mathematical goal is to find the vehicle path that maximizes the line integral of the uncer-tainty of field estimates along this path. Sampling this path can im-prove the accuracy of the field estimates the most. While achieving this objective, several constraints must be satisfied and are imple-mented. They relate to vehicle motion, intervehicle coordination, communication, collision avoidance, etc. The MILP formulation is quite powerful to handle different problem constraints and flex-ible enough to allow easy extensions of the problem. The formu-lation covers single-and multiple-vehicle cases as well as single-and multiple-day formulations. The need for a multiple-day for-mulation arises when the ocean sampling mission is optimized for several days ahead. We first introduce the details of the formula-tion, then elaborate on the objective function and constraints, and finally, present a varied set of examples to illustrate the applica-bility of the proposed method.

	abstract = {The paper develops and demonstrates a method of classifying oceanographic processes using an autonomous-underwater vehicle (AUV). First, we establish the “mingled-spectrum principle” which concisely relates observations from a moving platform to the frequency-wavenumber spectrum of the surveyed process. This principle clearly reveals the role of the AUV speed in mingling time and space. An AUV can distinguish between oceanographic processes by jointly utilizing temporal and spatial information. A parametric tool for designing an AUV spectral classifier is then developed based on the mingled-spectrum principle. An AUV’s controllable speed tunes the separability between the mingled spectra of different processes. This property is the key to optimizing the classifier’s performance. As a case study, AUV-based classification is applied to distinguish ocean convection from internal waves. It is demonstrated that at a higher AUV speed, convection’s distinct spatial feature is highlighted to the advantage of classification. Finally, the AUV classifier is tested by the Labrador Sea Convection Experiment of February 1998. We installed an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter in an AUV and it measured flow velocity in the Labrador Sea. Based on the vertical flow velocity, the AUV-based classifier captures convection’s occurrence. This finding is supported by other oceanographic observations in the same experiment.},

A global-positioning-system ionospheric scintillation and TEC monitor (GISTM) receiver (model GSV4004A) was used to record scintillations and the total electron content (TEC). The polar ionosphere is more sensitive to phase than to amplitude scintillations. Occurrence of amplitude scintillation is confined to well-defined regions, while phase scintillation shows a strong characterization both in magnetic latitude and magnetic local time. Occurrence of amplitude and phase scintillation increases during disturbed compared with quiet days. During disturbed days, the phase-scintillation region is displaced towards lower latitudes, following the auroral oval. The observed noon peak in scintillation occurrence may indicate that the irregularities that generate scintillation are caused by precipitation in the daytime cusp/cleft region. A significant enhancement of the TEC and the rate of change of the TEC index (ROTI) signified transits of polar-cap patches across different satellite trajectories during geomagnetic storms. We found that patches are most likely to occur when IMF Bz is southward and/or Kp{\textgreater}4. Loss of signal lock was more for the L2 signal than for L1, and shows a maximum in the morning sector. Positional errors tend to increase during disturbed conditions.},

On January 13, 2013 from Ny-Ålesund, several polar cap patches were observed to exit the polar cap into the auroral oval, and were then termed auroral blobs. This gave us an unprecedented opportunity to compare the relative scintillation levels associated with these three phenomena.

Our observations indicate that most patches in the nightside polar cap have produced significant scintillations, but not all of them. Since the blobs are formed after patches merged into auroral regions, in space weather predictions of GPS scintillations, it will be important to enable predictions of patches exiting the polar cap.},

During the evening of 30 October a narrow stream of high electron concentration plasma crossed the polar cap in the antisunward ionospheric convection. A GPS scintillation receiver in the European high arctic, operating at 1.575 GHz, experienced both phase and amplitude scintillation on several satellite-to-ground links during this period. Close examination of the GPS signals revealed the scintillation to be co-located with strong gradients in Total Electron Content (TEC) at the edge of the plasma stream. The gradient-drift instability is a likely mechanism for the generation of the irregularities causing some of the scintillation at L band frequencies during this storm. The origin of the high TEC is explored and the possible implications of the work for scintillation forecasting are noted. The results indicate that the GPS scintillation over Svalbard can originate from traceable ionospheric plasma structures convecting from the American sector.},

	abstract = {While modern GPS receiver differential code bias estimation techniques have become highly refined, they still demonstrate unphysical behavior, namely, notable solar cycle variability. This study investigates the nature of these seasonal and solar cycle bias variabilities in the polar cap region using single-station bias estimation methods. It is shown that the minimization of standard deviation bias estimation technique is linearly dependent on the user's choice of shell height, where the sensitivity of this dependence varies significantly from 1 total electron content unit (1 TECU = 1016 el m−2) per 4000 km in solar minimum winter to in excess of 1 TECU per 90 km during solar maximum summer. Using an ionosonde, we find appreciable shell height variability resulting in bias variabilities of up to 2 TECU. Comparing northward face Resolute Incoherent Scatter Radar (RISR-N) measurements to a collocated GPS station, we find that RISR-derived GPS receiver biases vary seasonally but not with solar cycle. RMS differences between bias estimation methods and observation between 2009 and 2013 were found to range from 2.7 TECU to 3.4 TECU, depending on method. To account for the erroneous solar cycle variability of standard bias estimation approaches, we linearly fit these biases to sunspot number, removing the trend. RMS errors after sunspot detrending these biases are reduced to 1.91 TECU. Also, these ISR-derived and sunspot-detrended biases are fit to ambient temperature, where a significant correlation is found. By using these temperature-fitted biases we further reduce RMS errors to 1.66 TECU. These results can be taken as further evidence of temperature-dependent dispersion in the GPS cabling and antenna hardware.},

	abstract = {Recently, a new generation of global positioning system (GPS) collars has become available that provides limited daily location fixes, a relatively long battery life, and are low-cost, compared to full-featured GPS collars. However, their performance is untested, and assessing these biases is needed to inform study designs and data analysis protocols. We used stationary tests of 15 Lotek LifeCycle GPS collars – an example of low-feature GPS collars – to measure the accuracy of location fixes. In addition, we deployed Lotek Lifecycle GPS collars on 153 caribou Rangifer tarandus and 24 bison Bison bison in Yukon and Alaska, to assess their field performance. We examined differences among species, sex, location fix schedule, and latitude, on four performance metrics (FSR, 3D-V FSR, DOP and DSR). Stationary trials indicated that mean precision (4.3 ± 4.0 m [SD]) and accuracy (6.0 ± 4.7 m) of location fixes was excellent, and FSR was good (87.2\%), albeit both were slightly affected by forest canopy cover. Field performance varied by species and sex. Notably, the mean DSR for male bison was dismal (27.4 ± 24.2\%) likely because of their behaviour, and the mean FSR, 3DV-FSR and DOP, for male caribou was poor (FSR = 57.3 ± 2.0\%), compared to collars deployed on female caribou (72.2 ± 1.7\%) or female bison (77.9 ± 1.4\%). We also observed that the VHF transmitters often failed when the collar malfunctioned. Biases in the accuracy and performance of these low-cost GPS collars should be taken into account when designing studies. Researchers contemplating investing in low-feature GPS collars require information on their ‘real-world’ performance so that they can decide whether they are appropriate for their intended application. Moreover, researchers need to consider biases in their GPS collar data prior to embarking on field studies and when conducting analyses with the data collected from them.},

To test this, Telonics GPS collars were placed on stakes during the summers of 2009 and 2010 throughout the region for varying lengths of time. The fix records produced by these collars were then collected and cleaned, leaving 30 samples. Using these records combined with a digital elevation model, eight variables were extracted and analysed in an attempt to find relationships, such that a fix rate could be predicted throughout the landscape. The results indicated that very few strong relationships existed. Densiometer values proved to be the only relationship between an environmental variable and fix rate. Available sky and aspect data produced results that were contrary to those expected. Overall, Telonics Generation 3 collars had extremely high fix rates, high accuracy, and low positional dilution of precision. Moreover, there was little variation in these results. This means that future GPS studies in the region would likely require minimal correction for fix rate bias. However, if corrections were to be made, more data would have to be gathered to ensure the results were statistically sound. The analysis suffered from the limitations of small sample size and low sample variance, among several others. Therefore, future studies should increase the number and diversity of sites tested.},

This can be achieved using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in conjunction with Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) or Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). Single frequency GPS-only SBAS is in service in some regions today and is reliant on ground and space infrastructure. ARAIM will be more autonomous and will rely on the multitude of signals and core constellations coming in the future. Here, we examine both SBAS and ARAIM in the context of aviation and maritime requirements in the Arctic. Results demonstrate that the introduction of multi-frequency and multi-constellation to these systems enables navigation safety in the Arctic. SBAS brings aircraft precision approach as well as precise maritime operations such as mapping. ARAIM also supports precision approach in addition to autonomous ice navigation at sea but falls short of precision maritime requirements. Copyright © 2016 Institute of Navigation},

We placed the collar in a range of cover types and compared locations reported by the collar to differentially-corrected GPS locations. We placed the collar on a free-ranging moose (Alces alces) and determined how selection of cover types, collar movement, and collar orientation affected GPS locations. On or off the moose, the GPS unit collected a location in {\textgreater}90\% of location attempts in areas with no or thin canopy cover, including mature deciduous canopies in winter. Under a mature conifer canopy or a mature deciduous canopy in summer, 60 to 70\% of location attempts were successful. Locations from the GPS unit in the collar were close to the expected precision of non-differentially corrected GPS (within 40 m 50\% of the time and 100 m 95\% of the time). Locations did not have a directional bias. Movement of the moose while a location was being attempted did not affect GPS locations. The moose occasionally laid down so the collar was horizontal. Although this decreased the success of location attempts, {\textless}1\% of location attempts were so affected. GPS radiotelemetry has great promise for expanding our knowledge about hourly, daily, and annual patterns in animal movements and habitat selection.},

	abstract = {In the late 1970s several normal-mode models existed which were widely used for predicting acoustic transmission-loss in the ocean however, each had its own problems. Typical difficulties included numerical instabilities for certain types of sound-speed profiles and failures to compute a complete set of ocean modes. In short, there was a need for a model that was robust, accurate, and efficient. In order to resolve these problems a new algorithm was developed forming the basis for the KRAKEN normal mode model. Over subsequent years, KRAKEN was greatly extended, with options for modeling ocean environments that are range-independent, range-dependent or fully 3-dimensional. The current version offers a specialist a vast number of options for treating ocean-acoustics problems or more generally acousto-elastic waveguides. On the other hand, it is easy for a less sophisticated user to learn the small subset of tools needed for the common problem of transmission-loss modeling in range-independent ocean environments. This report addresses the need for a more complete users guide to supplement the on-line help files. The first chapters give a fairly technical description of the mathematical and numerical basis of the model. Additional chapters give a simpler description of its use and installation in a manner that is accessible to less scientifically-oriented readers.},

A popular heuristic for k-means clustering is Lloyd's (1982) algorithm. We present a simple and efficient implementation of Lloyd's k-means clustering algorithm, which we call the filtering algorithm. This algorithm is easy to implement, requiring a kd-tree as the only major data structure. We establish the practical efficiency of the filtering algorithm in two ways. First, we present a data-sensitive analysis of the algorithm's running time, which shows that the algorithm runs faster as the separation between clusters increases. Second, we present a number of empirical studies both on synthetically generated data and on real data sets from applications in color quantization, data compression, and image segmentation.},

The bootstrap provides statistical inferences—standard error and bias estimates, confidence intervals, and hypothesis tests—without assumptions such as Normal distributions or equal variances. As such, bootstrap methods can be remarkably more accurate than classical inferences based on Normal or t distributions. The bootstrap uses the same basic procedure regardless of the statistic being calculated, without requiring the use of application-specific formulae. This article may provide two big surprises for many readers. The first is that the bootstrap shows that common t confidence intervals are woefully inaccurate when populations are skewed, with one-sided coverage levels off by factors of two or more, even for very large samples. The second is that the number of bootstrap samples required is much larger than generally realized.

	abstract = {Acoustics play a central role in humankind’s interactions with the ocean and the life within. Passive listening to ocean “soundscapes” informs us about the physical and bio-acoustic environment from earthquakes to communication between ﬁsh. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to ﬁsheries and biodiversity related interests. The two together in a multi-purpose network can lead to discovery and improve understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, and marine hazards and maritime safety. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of sound generated and utilized by marine life as well as other natural (wind, rain, ice, seismics) and anthropogenic (shipping, surveys) sources, has dramatically increased worldwide to enhance understanding of ecological processes. Characterizing ocean soundscapes (the levels and frequency of sound over time and space, and the sources contributing to the sound ﬁeld), temporal trends in ocean sound at different frequencies, distribution and abundance of marine species that vocalize, and distribution and amount of human activities that generate sound in the sea, all require passive acoustic systems. Acoustic receivers are now routinely acquiring data on a global scale, e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System hydroacoustic arrays, various regional integrated ocean observing systems, and some proﬁling ﬂoats. Judiciously placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed PAM and other systems provide: (1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability, taking advantage of the inherent integrating nature of acoustic travel-time data using tomography; and (2) acoustic positioning (“underwater GPS”) and communication services enabling basin-scale undersea navigation and management of ﬂoats, gliders, and AUVs. This will be especially valuable in polar regions with ice cover. Routine deployment of sources during repeat global-scale hydrographic ship surveys would provide high spatial coverage snapshots of ocean temperatures. To fully exploit the PAM systems, precise timing and positioning need to be broadly implemented. Ocean sound is now a mature Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) “essential ocean variable,” which is one crucial step toward providing a fully integrated global multi-purpose ocean acoustic observing system.},

	abstract = {Integrated acoustic communication and navigation for underwater vehicles provides dual functionality in a single system which reduces cost, size, power and potential acoustic interference. A combination of time and code division multiplexing is used to allow long baseline navigation and bidirectional communication for a number of vehicles operating simultaneously in the same area. The communication system uses multi-rate phase coherent modulation to maximize throughput for the uplink from a vehicle to a central node, and code-division multiple-access using a simple frequency-hopping scheme. The data rate and modulation methods are completely programmable and may be selected based on the application requirements and the propagation conditions present between the different vehicles in the network. While one or several vehicles may use time-multiplexed long-baseline (LBL) navigation, when the number of vehicles grows large, the time between fixes becomes unacceptably long. Thus in addition to LBL, a second mode of navigation is also available for use with swarms of vehicles such as the surf-zone crawlers proposed for mine counter-measure applications. This second mode employs navigation broadcasts initiated by the central controller and incorporates three additional fixed nodes that transmit in response. The time differences of arrival measured at the vehicle are used to determine its location.},

A high-speed link allows data to be sent from instruments to the surface in real-time, and a slower downlink is available to send commands to the remote units. The objective is to develop a cost-efficient, reliable link which will allow real-time data from anywhere in the water column to be transmitted to the surface and then forwarded via satellite link to a user anywhere on the globe. The system operates at 15-20 Khz and uses multiple frequencyshift keying (MFSK) modulation. Bit rates are adjustable, but 1200 bits per second has been selected for this application. The tones which make up the MFSK signal are decoded at the receiver with a Fourier transform implemented on a sophisticated signal processor. The processor can also be programmed to include an error-correction decoder, adaptive equalizer and data packet synchronizer. A simple, low baud rate, command link enables the use of an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) strategy which further increases the reliability of the up-link. A prototype system has been successfully tested at 1200 bits per second over a 3000 meter vertical path. Additional development work on the receiver, command link, and the transmitter is ongoing.},

	doi = {10.1109/OCEANS.1996.568294},
	abstract = {Acoustic positioning systems typically use the first acoustic arrival from each beacon to determine ranges to known beacon locations, and subsequent multipath arrivals are blanked out. As long as the first arrival is reliably present, these systems are dependable, but in many realistic positioning scenarios, the expected first arrival may be blocked by underwater obstacles or masked by noise. If a subsequent multipath arrival is mistaken for the missing first arrival, a position error will result. This paper presents a positioning system which uses the full multipath structure of the received signal to make the system robust to the fading of individual arrivals. The system determines its position by a two-step process. First, the detected arrivals in the multipath structure are identified with physical ray paths through the environment using a new algorithm which is robust to the disappearance of a subset of the predicted and measured arrivals. Then, the differences in arrival times between the measured arrivals and the predicted ray arrivals are used in a linear inversion to produce a position estimate. The operation of the system is simulated in a typical coastal environment where arrivals become unexpectedly absent due to blocking by unknown bottom topography, and where a high ambient noise level often produces missed arrivals and false detections.},

	abstract = {Spherical positioning systems determine position by measuring acoustic travel times from beacons at known locations. To make this travel time measurement, the receiver must know exactly when each beacon transmitted. Hyperbolic positioning systems determine position by measuring differences in travel time between signals from the beacons. The hyperbolic receiver does not need to know when the beacons transmitted, only that they all transmitted at the same time or with known delays relative to each other. The spherical system, which must know the transmit time exactly, and the hyperbolic system, which does not know transmit time at all can be seen as the two endpoints of a continuum of systems parameterised by the accuracy with which the transmit time is known. This paper demonstrates that the Cramer-Rao bounds for position accuracy approach those of the spherical navigation system as the variance in the transmit time estimate approaches zero, and approach those of the hyperbolic positioning system as the variance in the transmit time estimate becomes infinite. This observation has practical application in that the position accuracy of a hyperbolic navigation system which transmits at regular time intervals may be improved if it estimates not only receiver position, but also the transmit time of the beacons. As the estimate of transmit time improves, the position resolution becomes closer to that of a spherical positioning system. This improvement in position accuracy is shown for a typical underwater acoustic positioning scenario.},

The periodic measurement of the under-ice topography is a key component of the experiment, and the authors make use of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) technology to provide a cost effective alternative to the use of nuclear submarines. As a proof of concept, the AUV Odyssey was used to obtain ice-topographic data from areas located up to 10 km from the base camp. Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial to successful completion of the mission and recovery of the vehicle. The planned mission is described together with the associated requirements for vehicle technology, with particular emphasis on the development of a robust, very long baseline acoustic navigation system.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	doi = {10.23919/OCEANS.2015.7404510},
	abstract = {There is an increasing interest in Arctic and Antarctic studies, both from a scientific and from a commercial point of view. Due to the unpredictable climate conditions and the ice cover, as well as the difficulty conducting AUV operations with support ships due to the cost and scarcity of icebreakers and the presence of thick ice, AUVs are an ever-increasing option due to their ability to survey underneath the ice at long intervals. With the increasing use of AUVs in unsupervised under-ice operations, users are becoming more receptive to the idea of these types of AUV missions, and the capability to do this is advancing. International Submarine Engineering Ltd is the only subsea AUV developer with the Arctic experience behind it, specifically in operational hours under the ice. There is no doubt that the basis for ISE's successes lies in using a reliable, robust AUV and the underlying twenty years of work contributed to its development. For ISE, research deployments in the 1980's and 1990's and subsequent AUV deployments also provided background experience that was invaluable. From there, pulling off a successful under-ice deployment was essentially a matter of planning and testing. An example of the capability of current AUVs to operate unsupervised is the high Arctic field work by two Arctic Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) built by ISE for Natural Resources Canada (NRCan). They were deployed in 2010 and 2011 to conduct under-ice bathymetric surveys in support of Canada's sovereignty claim under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). These were the first long range AUV missions to have been undertaken at high latitude, and the first in which seabed survey data was successfully gathered over long distances working from both ice camps and icebreakers. As Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are now exploring more challenging terrain than ever, the need for an obstacle avoidance system has become apparent. Obstacle avoidance systems (OAS) in unmanned systems are far from new. However, adapting existing methodologies to AUVs presents a new set of challenges. Last year, International Submarine Engineering Ltd (ISE) tackled the task of adding an OAS to its line of Explorer AUVs. ISE's experience with obstacle avoidance strategies started in 1985 when the technology was added to ARCS, ISE's first AUV. ISE is the only company in the world with proven under the ice capability using AUVs.},

	title = {12 days under ice – an historic {AUV} deployment in the {Canadian} {High} {Arctic}},
	doi = {10.1109/AUV.2010.5779651},
	abstract = {In March and April 2010, an International Submarine Engineering (ISE) Explorer Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV), built for Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), was deployed to Canada's High Arctic. Its mission was to undertake under-ice bathymetric surveys in support of Canada's United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) Outer Continental Shelf claim. During this deployment several under-ice records were broken and several new technologies were demonstrated. This achievement was in part the result of the development work that ISE and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) undertook from 1993 to 1996 on the Theseus AUV during the Spinnaker program. During this program Theseus successfully completed two 200 km under-ice missions from CFS Alert on Ellesmere Island. NRCan's AUV is an ISE Explorer class vehicle, with several innovative additions to make it suitable for Arctic survey work. Most notable are a 4000 m depth rated variable ballast system, a 1500 Hz long range homing system, and under ice charging and data transfer capabilities. A Short Range Localization (SRL) system was also developed for close range positioning. The homing and SRL systems were developed by Canadian defense scientists and engineers at DRDC. The Explorer's range was extended to approximately 400 km by adding an additional hull section to accommodate extra batteries. The Main Camp near Borden Island (78°13.50'N, 112°38.87'W) was the launch site for the AUV. It was launched from an 8 m by 2.5 m ice-hole, cut through 2 - 3 m of thick ice. After several test dives its first mission was a transit to a Remote Camp, over 300 km to the northwest. The AUV autonomously homed into the Remote Camp and was successfully docked at the ice-hole where, without being removed from the water, it was charged and survey data was downloaded, all through a 1.5 m square ice hole. Subsequently, a second survey mission greater than 300 km in round trip length was undertaken, after which the AUV returned back to the Remote Camp. Finally, the vehicle embarked on a return mission to the Main Camp for recovery. From beginning to end, the AUV spent nearly 12 days under the ice before being successfully recovered. In total, close to 1000 km of under ice survey was accomplished between the AUV launch, Remote Camp mission, and recovery. The AUV reached depths of 3160 m and transited at an average speed of 1.5 m/s at an altitude of 130 m off the seabed. ISE and DRDC are now preparing for a 2011 deployment to collect additional data UNCLOS data. Aspects of the pre-deployment that will be presented include fail-safe provisions, mission planning, risk assessment, and mission logistics. Operational aspects to be discussed will include dealing with AUV operations in the extreme cold, initialization of the inertial navigation system, under-ice acoustics, acoustic homing to the recovery site and the procedures for recovery.},

Here we pair detailed hydrographic and bathymetric measurements collected with an autonomous underwater vehicle as close as 150 m from the ice–ocean interface of the Saqqarliup sermia–Sarqardleq Fjord system, West Greenland, with modeled and observed subglacial discharge locations and magnitudes. We ﬁnd evidence of two main types of subsurface glacially modiﬁed water (GMW) with distinct properties and locations. The two GMW locations also align with modeled runoff discharged at separate locations along the grounded margin corresponding with two prominent subcatchments beneath Saqqarliup sermia. Thus, near-ice observations and subglacial discharge routing indicate that runoff from this glacier occurs primarily at two discrete locations and gives rise to two distinct glacially modiﬁed waters. Furthermore, we show that the location with the largest subglacial discharge is associated with the lighter, fresher glacially modiﬁed water mass. This is qualitatively consistent with results from an idealized plume model.},

In conducting this study, the committee found that even the most moderate current trends in climate, if continued, will present new national security challenges for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. While the timing, degree, and consequences of future climate change impacts remain uncertain, many changes are already underway in regions around the world, such as in the Arctic, and call for action by U.S. naval leadership in response.\nThe terms of reference (TOR) directed that the study be based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and other peer-reviewed assessment. Therefore, the committee did not address the science of climate change or challenge the scenarios on which the committee's findings and recommendations are based. National Security Implications of Climate Change for U.S. Naval Forces addresses both the near- and long-term implications for U.S. naval forces in each of the four areas of the TOR, and provides corresponding findings and recommendations.
