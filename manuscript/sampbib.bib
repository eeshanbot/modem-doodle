abstract = {The particular sensitivity of the Arctic to climate change is well established, and the significance to undersea operations can be dramatic. As part of the recent ICEX16 US Navy Exercise in the Beaufort Sea, MIT deployed an autonomous underwater vehicle with a towed hydrophone array below the ice cover for assessing the climate induced changes to the undersea ambient noise environment. The safe underwater operation depended on navigation updates from the submarine tracking range being communicated to the vehicle for fusion with the onboard inertial navigation. However, the changes in the environment severely deteriorated the tracking performance compared to previous deployments. The reason was clearly associated with a previously observed neutrally bouyant layer of warm Pacific water persistently spreading throughout the Beaufort Sea, which severely alters the acoustic environment with dramatic effects for both long and short range acoustic sensing, communication and navigation. This paper describes the effects observed and discusses how robust acoustic connectivity in this environment makes it paramount that the manned or unmanned undersea platforms are capable of adapting to the environment for sensing, communication and navigation.},

abstract = {Four acoustic Seagliders were deployed in the Philippine Sea November 2010 to April 2011 in the vicinity of an acoustic tomography array. The gliders recorded over 2000 broadband transmissions at ranges up to 700 km from moored acoustic sources as they transited between mooring sites. The precision of glider positioning at the time of acoustic reception is important to resolve the fundamental ambiguity between position and sound speed. The Seagliders utilized GPS at the surface and a kinematic model below for positioning. The gliders were typically underwater for about 6.4 h, diving to depths of 1000 m and traveling on average 3.6 km during a dive. Measured acoustic arrival peaks were unambiguously associated with predicted ray arrivals. Statistics of travel-time offsets between received arrivals and acoustic predictions were used to estimate range uncertainty. Range (travel time) uncertainty between the source and the glider position from the kinematic model is estimated to be 639 m (426 ms) rms. Least-squares solutions for glider position estimated from acoustically derived ranges from 5 sources differed by 914 m rms from modeled positions, with estimated uncertainty of 106 m rms in horizontal position. Error analysis included 70 ms rms of uncertainty due to oceanic sound-speed variability.},

abstract = {This study identifies general characteristics of methods to estimate the absolute range between an acoustic transmitter and a receiver in the deep ocean. The data are from three days of the PhilSea10 experiment with a single fixed transmitter depth (∼998 m) and 150 receiver depths (∼210–5388 m) of known location, and a great-circle transmitter-receiver distance of ∼510 km. The proposed ranging methods compare observed acoustic records with synthetic records computed through the HYCOM (hybrid coordinate ocean model) model. More than 8900 transmissions over 3 days characterize the statistical variation of range errors. Reliable ranging methods de-emphasize the parts of the data records least likely to be reproduced by the synthetics, which include arrival amplitudes, the later parts of the acoustic records composed of nearly horizontally launched rays (i.e., the finale), and waves that sample a narrow span of ocean depths. The ranging methods proposed normalize amplitudes, measure travel times, or reject parts of the waveforms beyond a critical time. All deliver reliable range estimates based on the time and path-averaged HYCOM model, although the final method performs best. The principles behind these methods are transportable and expected to provide reliable range estimates in different deep water settings.},

abstract = {Attention mechanisms play a central role in NLP systems, especially within recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Recently, there has been increasing interest in whether or not the intermediate representations offered by these modules may be used to explain the reasoning for a model's prediction, and consequently reach insights regarding the model's decision-making process. A recent paper claims that 'Attention is not Explanation' (Jain and Wallace, 2019). We challenge many of the assumptions underlying this work, arguing that such a claim depends on one's definition of explanation, and that testing it needs to take into account all elements of the model. We propose four alternative tests to determine when/whether attention can be used as explanation: a simple uniform-weights baseline; a variance calibration based on multiple random seed runs; a diagnostic framework using frozen weights from pretrained models; and an end-to-end adversarial attention training protocol. Each allows for meaningful interpretation of attention mechanisms in RNN models. We show that even when reliable adversarial distributions can be found, they don't perform well on the simple diagnostic, indicating that prior work does not disprove the usefulness of attention mechanisms for explainability.},

abstract = {The Arctic Ocean is undergoing dramatic changes, the most apparent being the rapidly reducing extent and thickness of the summer ice cover. As has been well established over prior decades, the environmental acoustics of the ice-covered Arctic is dominated by two major effects: the highly inhomogeneous ice cover, and the monotonically upward refracting sound speed profile, the combination of which forces all sound paths to be exposed to strong scattering loss and the associated loss of coherence. In some portions of the Arctic Ocean, however, a persistent inflow of a shallow ‘tongue' of warm Pacific water has recently been strengthening, which has dramatically altered the acoustic environment, creating a strong acoustic duct between approximately 100 and 200 m depth. This duct has the potential of trapping sound out to significant ranges (80-100 km) without interacting with the ice cover, resulting in much higher coherence and signal preservation. Acoustic noise measurement results collected with a vertically suspended array during ICEX 2016 illustrate the spatial and temporal noise properties in the presence of this acoustic duct at different depths. Comparisons of the ICEX 2016 data are also made with modeled Arctic noise data.},

abstract = {An automated, easily deployed Ice-Tethered Profiler (ITP) instrument system, developed for deployment on perennial sea ice in the polar oceans to measure changes in upper ocean water properties in all seasons, is described, and representative data from prototype instruments are presented. The ITP instrument consists of three components: a surface subsystem that sits atop an ice floe; a weighted, plastic-jacketed wire-rope tether of arbitrary length (up to 800 m) suspended from the surface element; and an instrumented underwater unit that employs a traction drive to profile up and down the wire tether. ITPs profile the water column at a programmed sampling interval; after each profile, the underwater unit transfers two files holding oceanographic and engineering data to the surface unit using an inductive modem and from the surface instrument to a shore-based data server using an Iridium transmitter. The surface instrument also accumulates battery voltage readings, buoy temperature data, and locations from a GPS receiver at a specified interval (usually every hour) and transmits those data daily. Oceanographic and engineering data are processed, displayed, and made available in near-real time (available online at http://www.whoi.edu/itp). Six ITPs were deployed in the Arctic Ocean between 2004 and 2006 in the Beaufort gyre with various programmed sampling schedules of two to six one-way traverses per day between 10- and 750-760-m depth, providing more than 5300 profiles in all seasons (as of July 2007). The acquired CTD profile data document interesting spatial variations in the major water masses of the Canada Basin, show the double-diffusive thermohaline staircase that lies above the warm, salty Atlantic layer, measure seasonal surface mixed layer deepening, and document several mesoscale eddies. Augmenting the systems already deployed and to replace expiring systems, an international array of more than one dozen ITPs will be deployed as part of the Arctic Observing Network during the International Polar Year (IPY) period (2007-08) holding promise for more valuable real-time upper ocean observations for operational needs, to support studies of ocean processes, and to facilitate numerical model initialization and validation. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Meteorological Society.},

abstract = { Climate induced changes in the Arctic Ocean have severely impacted underwater acoustic communication and navigation; understanding underwater noise characteristics is critical to improving the performance of these operations. Ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea recorded in experiments more than 20 years apart (SIMI94 and ICEX16) are compared to determine differences that may be attributed to the region's rapidly changing environment. Spectral comparison shows noise within 20–350 Hz is ∼30 dB louder in 1994 than 2016; however, this is likely due to higher array self noise during SIMI94. Beamforming results show ambient noise vertical directionality is focused near the horizontal during SIMI94 but more spread in elevation during ICEX16, with a robust noise notch at the horizontal. Numerical modeling demonstrates that this difference may be attributed to ambient noise during ICEX16 being dominated by surface noise sources at discrete ranges rather than the historical assumption of a continuous and uniform distribution of sources. Temporal statistics of transient ice events show more acoustic activity during SIMI94 than ICEX16 and appear to support the new proposed surface source distribution for ICEX16. },

abstract = {The absence of the global positioning system (GPS) is a challenge to navigation and localization in the underwater environment. Thus, for precise and accurate navigation, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) often rely on very precise (yet very expensive and high energy consumption) inertial strap-down sensors which require external observations to constrain their dead-reckoned position error over time-e.g., Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) or acoustic positioning systems. Recent advances in acoustic navigation methodologies are enabling AUVs to extend submerged mission time by providing external position corrections and thereby constraining position error. Additionally, advances in microelectromechanical system (MEMS) inertial sensor technology has drastically lowered the size, power consumption, and cost of inertial sensors; however, they are still noisy and accumulate error over time. This paper builds on recent advances in single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) acoustic navigation and investigates the degree of bounding position error for small AUVs with a minimal navigation strap-down sensor suite, relying on a consumer grade MEMS inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a vehicle's dynamic model velocity. A real time implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), containing bias estimation, is obtained in the field with two Ocean-Server, Inc. Iver2 vehicles, and results show an average position error of 10.26 meters and 12.95 meters over a distance traveled of 1.73 kilometers and 1.91 kilometers, respectively.},

abstract = {The relatively shallow sound speed minimum known as the Beaufort Duct, present during the Canada Basin Acoustic Propagation Experiment, enabled transmissions from acoustic sources moored within the duct to Seaglider receivers at ranges up to 480 km. The receptions from these broadband sources were used to position the Seagliders at the time of reception both using ranges estimated in real-time and by the acoustic arrival matching (AAM) method, which infers ranges from comparisons with acoustic propagation models in post-processing. Preliminary results indicate that a posteriori data errors are reduced by a factor of 4 or 5 by implementing the AAM localization method.},

We present an integrated communications and navigation system, where a single synchronized digital communication packet is used to both provide tracking and data to the operator. In response, a navigation correction is telemetered to the vehicle. This system was deployed and operating during the ICEX20 experiment in the Beaufort Sea in March 2020. The variability of acoustic propagation with depth in the Beaufort Sea imposes a challenge to ensure reliable connectivity between the vehicle and the topside operators (in this case, via ice buoys). In the context of this under-ice system, where the ice buoys have multiple receiver and transmitter depths, we explore a self-adapting network that uses oceanographic and propagation modeling to predict the expected optimal receiver depth layer and transmitter hydrophone.},

The system operates at 900 Hz, and has programmable bandwidth, from 25 to 100 Hz. The communications data rate for the system is several bits per second, sufficient to transmit the GPS location of the buoys and several bytes of data to vehicles under the ice. The system was deployed in March of 2014 and operated through the fall of 2014, testing the performance of both the navigation and communications capabilities of the system in conjunction with Seagliders deployed by the University of Washington. Ranges of greater than 400 km were achieved with range accuracy of 40 m RMS for the case where the speed of sound is known. The long range and excellent accuracy were the result of ducted sound propagation in the Beaufort Sea.},

Additionally, the virtual ocean channel simulator is designed to perform in real time by coupling less frequent asynchronous queries to high-fidelity models of the ocean environment and acoustic propagation with frequent pertubation-based updates for the exact position of the simulated AUVs. The results demonstrate the performance of this system using the WHOI Micro-Modem 2 hardware in the virtual ocean environment of the Arctic Beaufort Sea around 73 degrees latitude.

The inverse problem is presented as a four-dimensional field estimation problem using a variational approach commonly used in oceanographic data assimilation. The current OAT approach is shown to be a special case of the general framework. The matched-field tomography (MFT) approach is also discussed within this context. A simple implementation of this novel approach is then investigated in the absence of a suitable oceanographic model, and acoustic propagation is accounted for using a standard parabolic equation model. The inverse equations derived are validated numerically through a simple inversion example, and some issues on environmental mismatch and computations are discussed. The developments then provide a basic framework for ongoing data-model melding in acoustically focused oceanographic sampling (AFOS) network.},

abstract = {This paper extends the progress of single beacon one-way-travel-time (OWTT) range measurements for constraining XY position for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV). Traditional navigation algorithms have used OWTT measurements to constrain an inertial navigation system aided by a Doppler Velocity Log (DVL). These methodologies limit AUV applications to where DVL bottom-lock is available as well as the necessity for expensive strap-down sensors, such as the DVL. Thus, deep water, mid-water column research has mostly been left untouched, and vehicles that need expensive strap-down sensors restrict the possibility of using multiple AUVs to explore a certain area. This work presents a solution for accurate navigation and localization using a vehicle's odometry determined by its dynamic model velocity and constrained by OWTT range measurements from a topside source beacon as well as other AUVs operating in proximity. We present a comparison of two navigation algorithms: an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a Particle Filter(PF). Both of these algorithms also incorporate a water velocity bias estimator that further enhances the navigation accuracy and localization. Closed-loop online field results on local waters as well as a real-time implementation of two days field trials operating in Monterey Bay, California during the Keck Institute for Space Studies oceanographic research project prove the accuracy of this methodology with a root mean square error on the order of tens of meters compared to GPS position over a distance traveled of multiple kilometers.},

abstract = {Underwater ambient noise from the Beaufort Sea, collected in March 2016, is analyzed to investigate the effect that environmental changes in the region have on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the ice-generated ambient noise. In particular, the influx of warm Pacific water, so called the Beaufort Lens, has dramatically altered the level and vertical directionality of ambient noise, creating a low noise zone in the ∼75–250 m depth interval with a noise notch at low grazing angles. It is also demonstrated how the observed noise vertical directionality is consistent with ice-mechanical activity along an active pressure ridge ∼30–50 km from the recording array, as shown by satellite imagery. The discrete ranges to this ice activity explain the peak arrival angles between −10 to −15 degrees in noise vertical directionality, as well as the horizontal noise notch. Transient noise events associated with the ice activity are analyzed using an image processing approach with hierarchical clustering applied to the recorded spectrograms. The observed events are grouped into three categories—short-time-broadband, long-time-narrowband, and long-time-broadband—each likely generated through a different mechanism by the ice cover. The spectral and temporal distribution of these transients are discussed.},

To better understand Arctic acoustics, a set of experiments known as the deep-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment and the shallow-water Canada Basin acoustic propagation experiment was conducted in the Canada Basin and on the Chukchi Shelf from summer 2016 to summer 2017. During the experiments, low-frequency signals from five tomographic sources located in the deep basin were recorded by an array of hydrophones located on the shelf. Over the course of the yearlong experiment, the surface conditions transitioned from completely open water to fully ice-covered. The propagation conditions in the deep basin were dominated by a subsurface duct; however, over the slope and shelf, the duct was seen to significantly weaken during the winter and spring. The combination of these surface and subsurface conditions led to changes in the received level of the sources that exceeded 60 dB and showed a distinct spacio-temporal dependence, which was correlated with the locations of the sources in the basin. This paper seeks to quantify the observed variability in the received signals through propagation modeling using spatially sparse environmental measurements.},

abstract = {This paper describes an acoustic navigation system that provides mesoscale coverage (hundreds of kilometers) under the ice and presents results from the first multi-month deployment in the Arctic. The hardware consists of ice-tethered acoustic navigation beacons transmitting at 900 Hz that broadcast their latitude and longitude plus several bytes of optional control data. The real-time under-ice navigation algorithm, based on a Kalman filter, uses time-of-flight measurements from these sources to simultaneously estimate vehicle position and depth-averaged local currents. The algorithm described herein was implemented on Seagliders, a type of autonomous underwater glider (AUG), but the underlying theory is applicable to other autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). As part of an extensive field campaign from March to September 2014, eleven acoustic sources and four Seagliders were deployed to monitor the seasonal melt of the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Beaufort and northern Chukchi Seas. Beacon-to-beacon performance was excellent due to a sound duct at 100 m depth where the transmitters were positioned; the travel-time error at 200 km has a standard deviation of 40 m when sound-speed is known, and ranges in excess of 400 km were obtained. Results with the Seagliders, which were not regularly within the duct, showed reliable acoustic ranges up to 100 km and more sparse but repeatable range measurements to over 400 km. Navigation results are reported for the real-time algorithm run in post-processing mode, using data from a 295-hour segment with significant time spent under ice.},

abstract = {This paper reports the development and experimental evaluation of a novel navigation system for underwater vehicles that employs Doppler sonar, synchronous clocks, and acoustic modems to achieve simultaneous acoustic communication and navigation. The system reported herein, which is employed to renavigate the vehicle in post-processing, forms the basis for a vehicle-based real-time navigation system. Existing high-precision absolute navigation techniques for underwater vehicles are impractical over long length scales and lack scalability for simultaneously navigating multiple vehicles. The navigation method reported in this paper relies on a single moving reference beacon, eliminating the requirement for the underwater vehicle to remain in a bounded navigable area. The use of underwater modems and synchronous clocks enables range measurements based on one-way time-of-flight information from acoustic data packet broadcasts. The acoustic data packets are broadcast from the single, moving reference beacon and can be received simultaneously by multiple vehicles within acoustic range. We report experimental results from the first deep-water evaluation of this method using data collected from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) survey carried out in 4000 m of water on the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge. We report a comparative experimental evaluation of the navigation fixes provided by the proposed synchronous acoustic navigation system in comparison to navigation fixes obtained by an independent conventional long baseline acoustic navigation system. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Spherical positioning systems determine position by measuring acoustic travel times from beacons at known locations. To make this travel time measurement, the receiver must know exactly when each beacon transmitted. Hyperbolic positioning systems determine position by measuring differences in travel time between signals from the beacons. The hyperbolic receiver does not need to know when the beacons transmitted, only that they all transmitted at the same time or with known delays relative to each other. The spherical system, which must know transmit time exactly, and the hyperbolic system, which does not know transmit time at all can be seen as the two endpoints of a continuum of systems parameterized by the accuracy with which the transmit time is known. This paper demonstrates that the Cramer-Rao bounds for position accuracy approach those of the spherical navigation system as the variance in the transmit time estimate approaches zero, and approach those of the hyperbolic positioning system as the variance in the transmit time estimate becomes infinite. This observation has practical application in that the position accuracy of a hyperbolic navigation system which transmits at regular time intervals may be improved if it estimates not only receiver position, but also the transmit time of the beacons. As the estimate of transmit time improves, the position resolution becomes closer to that of a spherical positioning system. This improvement in position accuracy is shown for a typical underwater acoustic positioning scenario.},

@article{Jakuba2008,
abstract = {The recent Arctic GAkkel Vents Expedition (AGAVE) to the Arctic Ocean's Gakkel Ridge (July/August 2007) aboard the Swedish icebreaker I/B Oden employed autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for water-column and ocean bottom surveys. These surveys were unique among AUV operations to date in requiring georeferenced navigation in proximity to the seafloor beneath permanent and moving ice cover. We report results for long-baseline (LBL) acoustic navigation during autonomous under-ice surveys near the seafloor and adaptation of the LBL concept for several typical operational situations including navigation in proximity to the ship during vehicle recoveries. Fixed seafloor transponders were free-fall deployed from the ship for deep positioning. The ship's helicopter collected acoustic travel times from several locations to georeference the transponders' locations, subject to the availability of openings in the ice. Two shallow beacons suspended from the ship provided near-surface spherical navigation in ship-relative coordinates. During routine recoveries, we used this system to navigate the vehicles into open water near the ship before commanding them to surface. In cases in which a vehicle was impaired, its position was still determined acoustically through some combination of its acoustic modem, the fixed seafloor transponders, the ship-deployed transponders, and an onboard backup relay transponder. The techniques employed included ranging adapted for a moving origin and hyperbolic navigation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Acoustics play a central role in humankind’s interactions with the ocean and the life within. Passive listening to ocean “soundscapes” informs us about the physical and bio-acoustic environment from earthquakes to communication between ﬁsh. Active acoustic probing of the environment informs us about ocean topography, currents and temperature, and abundance and type of marine life vital to ﬁsheries and biodiversity related interests. The two together in a multi-purpose network can lead to discovery and improve understanding of ocean ecosystem health and biodiversity, climate variability and change, and marine hazards and maritime safety. Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) of sound generated and utilized by marine life as well as other natural (wind, rain, ice, seismics) and anthropogenic (shipping, surveys) sources, has dramatically increased worldwide to enhance understanding of ecological processes. Characterizing ocean soundscapes (the levels and frequency of sound over time and space, and the sources contributing to the sound ﬁeld), temporal trends in ocean sound at different frequencies, distribution and abundance of marine species that vocalize, and distribution and amount of human activities that generate sound in the sea, all require passive acoustic systems. Acoustic receivers are now routinely acquiring data on a global scale, e.g., Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization International Monitoring System hydroacoustic arrays, various regional integrated ocean observing systems, and some proﬁling ﬂoats. Judiciously placed low-frequency acoustic sources transmitting to globally distributed PAM and other systems provide: (1) high temporal resolution measurements of large-scale ocean temperature/heat content variability, taking advantage of the inherent integrating nature of acoustic travel-time data using tomography; and (2) acoustic positioning (“underwater GPS”) and communication services enabling basin-scale undersea navigation and management of ﬂoats, gliders, and AUVs. This will be especially valuable in polar regions with ice cover. Routine deployment of sources during repeat global-scale hydrographic ship surveys would provide high spatial coverage snapshots of ocean temperatures. To fully exploit the PAM systems, precise timing and positioning need to be broadly implemented. Ocean sound is now a mature Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) “essential ocean variable,” which is one crucial step toward providing a fully integrated global multi-purpose ocean acoustic observing system.},

	abstract = {Use of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to obtain environmental observations beneath coastal sea ice offshore of Barrow, AK, is described. This study is motivated by the desire to obtain cross-shore hydrographic transects (temperature, salinity, and velocity versus depth) that would provide estimates of the transport of relatively dense, salty water from the Chukchi Sea to the Arctic Ocean in winter. Although person-portable AUVs are well suited to the task, it was recognized that achieving the science goals would require increasing the range of acoustic navigation and communication as well as developing a robust approach to through ice deployment and recovery. These needs drove three modifications to the AUV: 1) incorporation of a lower frequency (10 kHz) transponder and associated hardware for navigation and communication; 2) addition of special-purpose sensors and hard- ware in a hull extension module; and 3) development of a homing algorithm utilizing Ultrashort Base Line acoustics. In March 2010, eight days of field work offshore of Barrow provided successful demonstration of the system. A total of 14 km of track lines be- neath a coastal ice floe were obtained from four missions, each successfully terminated by net-capture recovery.},

In conducting this study, the committee found that even the most moderate current trends in climate, if continued, will present new national security challenges for the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. While the timing, degree, and consequences of future climate change impacts remain uncertain, many changes are already underway in regions around the world, such as in the Arctic, and call for action by U.S. naval leadership in response.\nThe terms of reference (TOR) directed that the study be based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios and other peer-reviewed assessment. Therefore, the committee did not address the science of climate change or challenge the scenarios on which the committee's findings and recommendations are based. National Security Implications of Climate Change for U.S. Naval Forces addresses both the near- and long-term implications for U.S. naval forces in each of the four areas of the TOR, and provides corresponding findings and recommendations. This report and its conclusions are organized around six discussion areas--all presented within the context of a changing climate.",
